            TEASER 

            T1RTC1 - EXT. PLANET PYGAR - PERPETUAL NOON

            On this reddish planet with a cluster of blue, swollen suns
            the CAMERA finds a small outcropping of interconnected domes. 
            The wind and dust of this inhospitable place swirl
            relentlessly.

            Credits appear in overlay.

            Through this, the silhouette of a figure carefully walks on a
            grated metal catwalk, marked by blue lumisticks.  His
            features are covered by the garments, breath mask and eyewear
            that protect him from the elements.  

            HIS POV: Taking each step - we hear his labored, filtered
            breathing and the sound of the small diaphragm alternately
            opening and closing.  He approaches the landing of "The
            Pavilion Dome".

            Above the pressure door hangs a bolted metal sign that says
            in large letters- "CAUTION: PYGAR ARCHEOLOGICAL EXCAVATION -
            LOOSE DIRT/ FALL ZONE/ RESTRICTED" under which a hand
            scrawled "inside joke" - like "wipe your feet" in the face of
            the swirling conditions or "gone fission"attests to
            overworked and wry Science Assistant humor.  The figure
            pushes a series of buttons and the light above turns from red
            (locked) to green (unlocked), the door opens and he steps
            into the relative darkness.

                                                                 CUT TO:

            T1RTC1B - INT. PAVILION DOME - THE CLEANER ROOM - SAME DAY

            - The door shuts - a moment of pitch black and silence.

            Suddenly LOUD blowers kick from the grating below him - VAPOR
            MIST AND A JET OF AIR BLOW UPWARD, consuming his body while
            glaring UV lights rid him of any stray microbes.  He slowly
            turns a few steps in the light, facing the camera.  Sudden
            silence and darkness as the process concludes, punctuated by
            A COMPUTER VOICE and some tones.  The regular FLUORESCENT
            room light snaps on from a vertical three-tube source (one
            bulb at a time: one, two - one sticks, he thumps it - on:
            three).  The room is now lit in cold contrast to the arid and
            orange exterior.

            The Computer Voice heralds an incoming message and the LARGE
            FLAT MONITOR on the wall comes to life.  The face of JACK
            NORRINGTON, an assistant, early 20's, competent, slim with a
            goatee and no discernible accent fills the screen.  

                                NORRINGTON 
                      Doctor Sinclair - I'm glad you're here. 
                      We were running sonic tests on level 6,
                      like you instructed - when we hit what we
                      thought was another fault.  We shut
                      everything down and sent in a probe -

            As he speaks, the figure doesn't look over at the monitor but
            simply reaches for the catch on his face protection.  There
            is a CLICK and a pressure hiss  - revealing that HE is really
            a SHE - This is DR. KENDRA SINCLAIR, late 30's - Black and
            Bretonian; she's young for her profession, driven and
            focused.

                                SINCLAIR 
                          (looks at her chronometer) )
                      Jesus Jack - It's 3:15 in the damn
                      morning.  (
                          (back to him)
                      --you didn't call me out here because of
                      a fault, did you.

                                NORRINGTON  
                      Er -no.

                                SINCLAIR
                      What then?

                                NORRINGTON
                          (at a loss)
                      Well- this...

            He reaches O.S and the monitor changes to the Probe readout
            of a "solid, boxy shape".  Numbers and multi-colored graphs
            fly by as it is scanned - revealing little.  

                                NORRINGTON (CONT'D)
                          (contained excitement)
                      This was lodged in a sealed alcove on 6. 
                      The scanners can't penetrate it and - 

            Sinclair narrows her eyes at the screen.  What is this?

                                SINCLAIR
                      I'll be right down.

            She presses a button and -

                                                                 CUT TO:

            T1RTC1C - INT. PYGAR PAVILION - SAME DAY

            A light fills our eyes.  It is part of a HOVERCAM, a floating
            camera system, that is moving into position facing us.

            HOVERCAM POV: WE SEE a series of FLASHES and images. An
            audible pop and whirr as the strobe goes off.

            FLASH

            An irregular spire, ancient.

            FLASH

            Hieroglyphic reliefs, alien.

            FLASH

            Part of an ornate door frame, chrome instruments and hands
            restoring and examining it.

            This is THE PAVILION. MERCURY VAPOR WORK LIGHTS illuminate a
            yawning excavation, some heavy equipment and a partially
            submerged RUIN that is worn and smashed in places - (having
            seen a lot of time in the sand until the domes were erected
            to protect it and the TEAM OF TECHNICIANS that crawl over it
            now).  Despite the crevices and shattered surfaces, the
            breathtaking beauty of this structure is still visible with
            its newly partially exposed majestic hieroglyphic obelisks
            and decorative surfaces. It is clearly not of human design -
            as is certainly evidenced by the size and shape of the
            DOORWAY.  The ATMOSPHERE in here is heavy and laden with time
            and airborne microsilt - and eerily still - helping to cast
            shafts of radiance in the workspace.

            ANGLE ON:  The pressure doors parting and Sinclair coming
            though them. She walks with purpose to the rail as busy
            people walk around her.  Camera cranes over her back and
            reveals the entire scene.  Sound of work fills the air.

                                NORRINGTON (OS)
                      Over here.

            She walks to a nearby WORKBENCH with EXAMINING EQUIPMENT on
            it.  Norrington is standing over a medium sized and very
            ornate carved object.  He looks at her and back down to it,
            sharing her reaction.  She is dumbstruck.

                                SINCLAIR 
                          (whispering half to herself and
                           half to it)
                      Oh..baby…where have you been hiding?

                                NORRINGTON  
                          (finally bursting)
                      It's unbelievable, Dr. Sinclair. After
                      digging up and cataloging 4,500 fragments
                      in this vacuous, filthy, dung hole...to
                      actually find something unique, something
                      complete, something undeniably -

            He's rambling.  She looks at him and he takes a breath.  

                                NORRINGTON (CONT'D)
                          (sheepishly)
                      Sorry.

            Sinclair carefully looks back down and adjusts an "Analyzer"
            which springs to life - lighting the object's ornate surface. 
            A "Magnifying Field" springs up and -

            FX: ZOOM - ZOOM

            --enlarges portions of the box before her eyes.  She gently
            manipulates her field of view until she finds - a groove.

                                SINCLAIR 
                      Hmmm.. There is an irregularity in its
                      surface -

            She picks up a small tool and tries to get a better look at
            it.  Norrington and a couple of others stare - fascinated.

            As she rubs against it with the tiny instrument, the small
            catch - depresses - CLICK! - and the "box" suddenly and
            mechanically SPRINGS TO LIFE- 

                                ALL 
                      ARRGHH!!

            Startled, they all jump back - not knowing exactly what to
            expect, but Sinclair is transfixed.  The box clicks like
            clockwork, arranging itself into a new "unlocked position".
            It stops and opens with a HISS - as if it hasn't seen the
            light of day in an eon, revealing a small mass of crystal and
            precious metals.  Not just any ARTIFACT - something special.

                                SINCLAIR  
                          (still transfixed) )
                      I don't' believe it.

                                NORRINGTON  
                          (in stone cold amazement) )
                      You did it.

            She moves in and gently takes it from the box.  It GLOWS ever
            so...She holds it up to the light.  CAMERA is TIGHT on
            ARTIFACT as light is behind it.

                                SINCLAIR (OS) 
                      We did it, Jack.  We did it.

            and in the REFRACTION of WHITE LIGHT we -

                                                                 CUT TO:

            T1RTC1C - INT. PYGAR COVERED LAMDING PAD - LATER 

            The BLINDING FURNACE OF THE CENTER OF THE ENGINES of a
            FREIGHTER warming up. Camera pulls out.

            Sinclair walks quickly to the ship with Norrington at her
            side.  Behind them, two assistants carry the box, now in a
            stasis tube. 

                                NORRINGTON 
                      Are you sure this is wise?

                                SINCLAIR 
                      What? I'll be back in a few days - I just
                      want to verify this find.  You've run the
                      show here before.

                                NORRINGTON
                      It's not that -

            She stops and takes a last look at the artifact as the two
            assistants carry it to the ship.  Norrington also glances at
            it - but then focuses on her.

                                NORRINGTON (CONT'D)
                      Look.  It's a long way to Cambridge. 
                      What if something happens?  I think we
                      should wait - I think -

                                SINCLAIR
                          (stopping him) )
                      Jack…I'll be fine...
                      (a beat)
                      Thanks.  

            She walks away from him and towards the ship -the engine
            whine is sharper and louder as she gets closer to it.

                                SINCLAIR  (CONT'D)
                          (shouting back to him) )
                       Don't wait up.  

            (She smiles and waves).

            Norrington watches her as she greets the pilot, VANCE, in MOS
            under the shrill sound of the engine.  They get in and the
            door closes. It lifts off and heads through the BAY DOORS.

            As it does, Norrington's expression changes; he looks more
            focused, intent.  He speaks into a small transmitter on his
            sleeve - now with a Rheinland accent.

                                NORRINGTON 
                          (into mic) )
                      I couldn't stop her.  She's on her way.

            Who is this guy?

            T1RTC1D - EXT. SPACE

            The ship clears the planet and links up with two fighters. 
            MUSIC.  They approach a jumpgate and go through.  Unknown to
            them another ship, the HORUS, fades from the blackness and
            follows them in, it cloaks.

            T1RTC1E - INT. COCKPIT - IN THE JUMP CHANNEL

            Vance hits a few switches.  Sinclair looks at the swirling
            cosmos outside the cockpit.

                                VANCE
                          (to escort)
                      Plotting second leg to Cambridge. Looks
                      good.  
                          (to Sinclair)
                      So what are we carrying this time,
                      Doctor?  

                                SINCLAIR
                      Vindication.

            She half-way smiles to herself as she looks out the cockpit
            glass.

                                VANCE
                          (jabbing - he knows she's lost
                           in thought)
                      A simple "none of your business, Vance",
                      would have sufficed.

                                SINCLAIR
                          (back to reality - a little
                           embarrassed)
                      Sorry.
                          (a beat)
                      For me - it's the answer to a question. 

                                VANCE
                      What question?

                                SINCLAIR
                      Is it really worth it?  

                                VANCE
                      Is what?

                                SINCLAIR
                      This --all of this.  What we do.  Who we
                      are.  What drives us.  Everything.  Do
                      you ever ask yourself that?

            SUDDENLY LIGHTS AND WARNINGS GO OFF.  

            ANGLE ON: HUD - A "form" appears.  A big one.

                                VANCE
                          (flatly)
                      Every damn day.  Hang on!

                                                                 CUT TO:

            T1RTC1F - EXT. SPACE

            Vance takes evasive action as the Horus suddenly decloaks. 
            The escorts fire on it but are vaporized.  Several energy
            blasts quickly disable the thrusters on Vance's ship and it
            is locked in a tractor beam.  The two ships are now
            travelling together at the same fantastic relative speed in
            the channel.

            The Horus' belly opens up and A RED CUTTER BEAM rips into
            Vance's cargo hold.

            CLOSER - and the tractor beam extracts the contents -
            including the artifact, It's case glinting in the beam and
            reflecting stars. 

            T1RTC1G - INT. COCKPIT - IN THE JUMP CHANNEL

            Seeing this -

                                SINCLAIR
                      NO!

            Sinclair suddenly grabs weapon control.

                                VANCE 
                      Hey! What are you --?  DON'T!

            But before he can stop her -

            T1RTC1H - EXT. SPACE - THE JUMP CHANNEL

            Several MISSILES FIRE POINT BLANK into the inner walls of the
            Horus' hold.  The explosion pitches the large ship into the
            wall of the Jump Channel and it tears it apart.  FLAMES - now
            travel through the channel like rising magma, on the heels of
            Vance's ship.

            T1RTC1I - INT. COCKPIT - IN THE JUMP CHANNEL

            They are buffeted and shaken violently.  ALL HELL IS BREAKING
            LOOSE.

            Cockpit POV:  The approaching end of the Jump Channel.
            FLAMES! Closing in on their view.  Everything is red and it's
            getting hot.  Vance leans on the stick.  SPARKS ERUPT in the
            cockpit.  Sinclair screams.  THIS IS IT!

            T1RTC1J - EXT. SPACE - THE OTHER SIDE

            The CAMERA spins slowly as the jump gate opens and a jet of
            flame spits out the little ship at great speed.  Vance
            manages to hit the reverse maneuvering thrusters to slow
            down, but even they finally sputter out.  Spent, they are
            adrift.

            T1RTC1K - INT. COCKPIT - THE OTHER SIDE

            Pitched forward and bathed in the RED emergency lights, Vance
            tries to get the systems back up.  The computer sites a long
            list of damages.  Sinclair twists, struggling to look...

                                SINCLAIR
                      The artifact --?

                                VANCE
                      It's gone, okay.  We're lucky to be
                      alive. 

            Sinclair stews.   She suddenly hits the glass hard with her
            fist.  

                                                            DISSOLVE TO:

            In the DOWNPOUR, a TRANSPORT lands as a REPORTER's VOICE is

                      The tragic loss of life and property has
                      the Colonies up in arms as the survivors

            CAMERA POV: (readouts and overlays) One of them is SYD
            MONTAGUE, forties, scruffy - he sees the camera and hides his
            face...

            ...and another is EDISON TRENT, twenties and THE PLAYER. 
            Camera focuses in on him as he is guided with the others
            towards the end of the landing pad.

                      regardless of the outcome, President

            ACT ONE

            A1RTC1 - INT. MANHATTAN BAR - A MOMENT LATER (PLAYS)

            Trent enters the bar.  The News runs overhead. People are
            mingling; some doing business, some just relaxing.  He just
            wants to take a load off and wearily sits at the bar.  The
            BARTENDER comes up and gives him that universal look for
            "Whatcha want?" 

                                TRENT
                      Red Fang.

            A GIRL at a corner booth glances at him - as she pretends to
            listen to the LIBERTY DIPLOMAT who is clearly speaking at
            her.  In fact, she seems like the type that very little
            escapes.  This is JUN'KO CRANE, early twenties, a half-Kusari
            and half-Liberty fixer.  Trent sees her watching him and
            after a moment of catching his eye, she seamlessly rejoins
            her conversation.  Trent's gaze is broken as the Bartender
            sets his drink down.

                                BARTENDER
                          (re: the girl)
                      Her name's Jun'ko Crane.  She's a
                      licensed fixer for Liberty.  If you're
                      looking for work --  

                                TRENT
                      The only thing I'm looking for right now
                      is this drink.

            Trent takes the first drink like his life depended on it. 
            The Bartender takes a closer look at him.  

                                BARTENDER
                      I know you, don't I?

                                TRENT
                      I don't think so.

                                BARTENDER
                      Yes.  I saw your face on the News. 
                      You're from Freeport Station, aren't you?

            Trent nods.

                                BARTENDER (CONT'D)
                      So, what happened out there?

                                TRENT
                      Which part?  The station being blown to
                      bits or the half-million of my ore that
                      it took with it?

            The Bartender silent grimaces and nods to himself - yeah,
            that sucks.  He pours two drinks and sets 'em down.

                                BARTENDER
                      -This one's on me.  

            Trent looks at it and back at him.  

                                BARTENDER (CONT'D)
                          (toasting)
                      It may not seem like it now but you're
                      lucky; not every man gets the chance to
                      start again.  
                          (a beat - then toasting)
                      To your good fortune in Liberty, my
                      friend.

            He downs it.   

                                TRENT
                      -it certainly can't get any worse.

            Trent drinks and looks around.

                      Again, the staggering news of a vicious
                      attack on Freeport Station that left
                      hundreds dead and many wounded.  The
                      Station, belonging to the House-
                      independent Commerce Guild, was utterly
                      destroyed by what Liberty officials have
                      now described as a terrorist attack.

                      Refugees arrived today in Liberty and
                      Kusari as transports from these capitols
                      rescued survivors -- these in Liberty.

                      An investigation by the Liberty Military
                      is underway, but the unofficial findings
                      so far suggest that the Terrorist Group,
                      The Order, might be responsible.

            A1RTC3RUMOR1 - MANHATTAN BAR - SAME DAY

            DRAKE, an intense looking LIBERTY GUARD, sits at a table. 
            Trent approaches him.

                                DRAKE
                      I hear you were on Freeport when it went
                      up.  You know, you're lucky to be alive.

            Trent looks over at the Bartender, who sees him and half
            smiles.  

                                TRENT
                      So people keep saying.

            He eyes Trent carefully, but keeps his light tone.

                                DRAKE
                      Know anything about the Order?

                                TRENT
                      Just what I hear.

                                DRAKE
                      It doesn't add up, you know: Freeport and
                      the others...in and out like that.  So
                      fast.  They must have some sort of
                      presence in Manhattan, a base perhaps-- 
                          (a beat)
                      or someone's helping them. 

            Off Trent's look.

                                DRAKE (CONT'D)
                      Did you know that over seventy-five
                      percent of all robberies of this kind are
                      an inside job.

            Trent shakes his head.

                                DRAKE (CONT'D)
                      It's true.

                                TRENT
                      I thought they were Terrorists.

                                DRAKE
                          (he nods)
                      But it looks like Orillion and his goons
                      might have been looking for something -
                      something special. 
                          (a beat)
                      Special enough to blow up an entire Space
                      Station to find.

            The Guard tries to read Trent.  Finally.

                                DRAKE (CONT'D)
                          (leans back and smiles)
                      Don't worry.  We'll get to the bottom of   
                      this, I promise you.  It's just a matter
                      of time.

            He gets up and finishes his drink.

                                LIBERTY GUARD
                          (almost as an afterthought)
                      Enjoy your stay in Manhattan, Mr. Trent.

            Trent nods his thanks as the Liberty Guard leaves.

            A1RTC4RUMOR2 - MANHATTAN BAR - SAME DAY

            As Trent walks up a LIBERTY MERCHANT, 30's, high energy,  is
            sitting with his ASSISTANT, who continues to hammer away on a
            small computer.  

                                ASSISTANT 
                          (to the Merchant)
                      Ozu's pulling out.

            The Merchant hops out of his seat and starts pacing wildly.

                                LIBERTY MERCHANT
                      Dammit.  Try to get him back.

                                ASSISTANT
                      He's gone, Sir.

            The Merchant sees Trent, who looks friendly enough.  He walks
            right up to him.

                                LIBERTY MERCHANT
                          (to Trent - blasting off)
                      So, tell me, friend -- Why do we pay such
                      huge taxes?  I thought it was to support
                      this great Government and Military
                      machine that we see all around us; to
                      certify and ensure our security and
                      reputation as a major power in commerce
                      and industry... 
                          (a beat)
                      So explain to then me why I can't keep a
                      deal alive with these other merchants?
                          (to his Assistant)
                      Cowards!

            Before Trent can answer - even if he could -

                                LIBERTY MERCHANT (CONT'D)
                          (imitating the other merchants)
                      Oh, it's too dangerous.  Oh, there's too
                      much trouble in the Borderworlds.  Oh,
                      you can't guarantee protection.  

                                LIBERTY MERCHANT (CONT'D)
                          (directly to Trent)
                      Let me tell you - there are no guarantees
                      in life, much like business.  You've got
                      to take chances.  Risk makes us rich. 
                      Understand?

                                TRENT
                      Yeah.

                                LIBERTY MERCHANT
                          (leans in closer to Trent - an
                           aside - sotto)
                      Although any more risk and I'm going to
                      take it in the shorts, if you get my
                      drift.
                          (to the Assistant)
                      Raise Ozu again!  Tell him. I'll double
                      his share.  Inscrutable, my ass.

            He breaks away and takes his seat, forgetting Trent who was a
            but a momentary diversion.  Trent remains bewildered.

                                ASSISTANT
                      Yes, sir. 

            A1RTC5 - INT. MANHATTAN BAR

            Trent approaches Juni at the corner table with a drink.  She
            sits alone and regards him coolly.

                                TRENT
                      Hi.  I saw you watching me as I came in.

                                JUNI
                          (chilly)
                      Yeah?

                                TRENT
                      I'm Trent.  
                          (long uncomfortable pause)
                      The Bartender said that you worked for
                      Liberty.

                                JUNI
                      And who do you work for?

                                TRENT
                      No one right now.

                                JUNI
                      Are you looking?

                                TRENT
                      Are you offering?

                                JUNI
                      Depends.  I see a lot of people who come
                      in and out of here.  Some think they're
                      hot shit.  All talk, no action...and I
                      don't really have the time to-

                                TRENT
                      You're in business right?

                                JUNI
                      I make a profit on completed missions. 

                                TRENT
                      Then you know about risk.

            She nods.

                                TRENT (CONT'D)
                      Well, so do I.  I just risked my neck and
                      my life's savings on a big score that
                      just went south with my ship and
                      everything else I owned. 

                                JUNI
                      Freeport Station?

            She saw him, too.

                                TRENT
                      Yep.  And of the two - I only managed to
                      salvage my neck.

            She doesn't exactly smile, but she does soften at his story. 
            She gets up to go.

                                JUNI
                      Well, if you're looking for work you've
                      come to the right place.  I can provide
                      the ship.  Just bring your neck around
                      the Equipment room later.

                                TRENT
                      I'll think about it, Miss Crane.

                                JUNI
                      Do so, Mr. Trent.  Oh, and if we're going
                      to work together, call me Juni.

            She leaves knowing his curiosity is piqued.  He's intrigued
            but stood his ground.  He smiles to himself and drinks up. 

            A1RTCSC6  - INT. MANHATTAN EQUIPMENT ROOM - LATER (PLAYS)

            CAMERA Cranes from below deck as Trent enters the room and
            pads towards the SMALL LIBERTY FIGHTER in the center.  SOUND
            of his hollow footsteps.  He slowly glances around as he
            walks --looking for Juni.  He puts a hand on the nose gear of
            the fighter and hears a noise.

            Camera is with him as he looks left - towards the noise - 

                                TRENT
                      Hello?

            TRENT'S POV: Down the long axis of the ship towards the wall. 
            Crates.  Benches.  Nothing else. 

            ANGLE ON: Trent - He's still looking as the camera REVEALS
            Syd suddenly standing over his right shoulder, looking
            directly into him.  Syd wasn't there before; WE see him
            before Trent does.

                                SYD
                      I need to talk to you.

            Trent is startled and takes a step back.

                                TRENT
                      Where did you come from, man?

                                SYD
                          (more emphatically)
                      I need to talk to you.  

            Trent is still trying to recover as Syd takes another step
            forward - very close.

                                SYD (CONT'D)
                      I know why the Station was attacked.

            Suddenly, the chatter of two people talking in the corridor
            cuts him off.  He shoots a paranoid glance off to the
            direction of the door as it opens.  Then Trent looks.

            ANGLE ON: Juni and MR. BURTON, the Gung-Ho Liberty Equipment
            Dealer, the 30th century's answer to Larry Tate, arguing as
            they enter the room.   

                                MR. BURTON (O.S.)
                      --if you do that there's no market in it
                      for me.  You've already cut me out of the
                      repeaters.

                                JUNI 
                          (she's got him)
                      It's only fair.

                                MR. BURTON 
                          (grumbling)
                      It ain't fair, Juni.  And it's not like I
                      have a lot of choice.

            Trent looks back --AND SYD IS GONE AGAIN.  He's still looking
            around as Juni and Burton walk towards him.

                                JUNI
                      Sure you've got a choice - if you're
                      suddenly allergic to making money. 
                      Haven't I always --ALWAYS - paid off?  

                                MR. BURTON
                      Well, yes.  But-

            Burton trails off - the deal is done.  Juni moves on to
            Trent, who is still slightly bewildered.  What happened?  She
            seems almost pleased to see him.

                                JUNI
                      Mr. Trent, I take it you're here to
                      accept a job with Liberty.

            It's apparent that she didn't see Syd.  Trent wonders if he
            did, but rather than look like a dufus he pulls off the
            smooth thing and stays on target.

                                TRENT
                      It's just Trent - and yeah.

            She nods in approval.

                                JUNI
                      Alright.  
                          (a beat)
                      You've come at a good time, Trent.  I've
                      got a surplus of work and could use a guy
                      who's "familiar with risk". 

            She half smiles but continues.

                                JUNI (CONT'D)
                      Not that this is dangerous.  I just need
                      a man who knows what he's doing.  Mr.
                      Burton here has graciously donated a ship
                      for you to use.  It doesn't have jump
                      capability yet but we'll see what we can
                      do about that later, right?

            That "right" is directed over her shoulder at Mr. Burton who
            is still wincing from the word "donated".

                                MR. BURTON
                          (sheepishly and under his
                           breath)
                      Right...

            A look from Juni.

                                MR. BURTON (CONT'D)
                          (more in line)
                       Right.  RIGHT. 

            He throws his hands up.  Pleased, she turns her attention
            back to Trent.

                                JUNI
                      Good.  All you have to do is baby-sit a
                      convoy of food and medical supplies,
                      Trent.  It shouldn't be any problem.  And
                      just to ease you into the game, the CO of
                      the Escort Wing will be along for the
                      ride.  Got it?

                                TRENT
                      No problem.

                                JUNI
                      Good, Mr. Burton will make sure your ship
                      is moved to the landing pad as soon as
                      it's outfitted.  I'll see you when you
                      get back.  

            She walks off, casting a last glance at Mr. Burton who demurs
            and puts up his hands.  Trent looks at the ship; it's  basic -
            but it'll do.

            A1RTC7RUMOR3 - EXT. MANHATTAN LANDING PAD - LATE AFTERNOON
            (PLAYS)

            Trent walks on the Landing Pad and up to his ship now at its
            place on the deck.  The clouds move behind him and the sun
            are overhead, casting everything in amber -  maybe he can
            begin again.  He glances over and sees a man looking off into
            the horizon.   He's still - He's not moving.  He's just
            breathing, eyes transfixed, his back to Trent.  Trent keeps
            glancing over at him as he checks out his ship. Finally.

                                TRENT
                          (to the man's back)
                      Hey.

            Nothing.

                                TRENT (CONT'D)
                      HEY.  Are you okay?

            The man, DOYLE LONNIGAN, 40's, looks like he hasn't slept in
            a week, turns slightly and nods and then back again.  The
            sound of the wind blowing hard. 

                                LONNIGAN
                          (his back to Trent)
                      I remember you.

                                TRENT
                      What?

                                LONNIGAN
                      On the Station.  On the rescue ship.  You
                      were there.

            Trent walks up to him and looks into Lonnigan's face.  Sees
            the craggly lines and bags under his eyes.

                                LONNIGAN (CONT'D)
                      You saw them, didn't you?  The one's who
                      did it?

                                TRENT
                      The Order?  No, I-

            The man churns, grabbing Trent's wrist (out of frame)

                                LONNIGAN
                      NO!  Not the Order.  The others.

                                TRENT
                      What the-

                                LONNIGAN
                      Out there waiting.  Just sitting there. 
                      Until the red alert...they picked off
                      ships that ran, one by one.

            Trent gets his hand free.

                                TRENT
                      Whoa.  Just settle down.

                                LONNIGAN
                          (quietly - almost in awe)
                      The ships - I saw them.  They looked like
                      the water under the ice on Florida Minor. 
                      Shimmering in and out..Could almost see
                      the stars through them...but they weren't
                      ours.  They weren't ours.  
                          (a beat)
                      I told them on the rescue ship.  They
                      said I had a head wound.  "Just relax". 
                      I can't relax --they're coming.  I see
                      them --they're coming!

            Trent looks at Lonnigan's head.  He's got a pretty bad gash
            and bruise.  He looks into Trent.

                                LONNIGAN (CONT'D)
                          (more focused)
                      But you believe me, don't you.  You were
                      there.  You saw them, didn't you?  You
                      believe me!  You believe me...

            His last words trail and he looks back off into the distance.
            Looking for his ships.

            MISSION 1

            See Mission Pack. (***NOTE: Derive MP from overview.)

            A1RTC8RUMOR4 - EXT. PITTSBURGH LANDING PAD (PLAYS)

            Trent is a little flushed from his first battle since the
            Freeport's destruction.  It was supposed to be an easy run -
            it wasn't.  

            As exits his ship, ROAMER VAN ARSDALE, the Pittsburgh
            Commodity Trader, a short red-faced man as shrill as Wallace
            Shawn and as shrewd as a Houston Lawyer, approaches him.

                                ROAMER (V.O.)
                      Excellent!

            Trent looks up.

                                ROAMER (CONT'D)
                      Excellent.  Excellent.  Excellent.  I'm
                      delighted to see you, Trent.  Supplies
                      have been running a bit short lately and
                      I have clients to service, you know.  I
                      think you're the first to get through the
                      recent attacks.  Juni must know what
                      she's doing.

                                TRENT
                          (still a little thrown)
                      Yeah, she must.  Now about my pay...

                                ROAMER
                      Ah, delighted to, my boy.  I'll transfer
                      it at once.

            Loot appears in his Account.  Roamer smiles a toothy grin
            only a lamprey would love.

            A1RTC9 - INT. PITTSBURGH BAR - LATER

            The Wing CO, HARVEY KING, 30's and fit, sits and has a well
            deserved drink. He's seen some action, making him look a
            little older than his years.  When he sees Trent walk in he
            calls him over.

                                KING
                      Trent.  Come here.  I've been waiting for
                      you.

            King slaps a heavy arm on him...

                                KING (CONT'D)
                      I wanted to congratulate you on your
                      baptism by fire.

            --and slides a drink in front of him.  Trent looks at King.

                                TRENT
                      Did you know the mission was going to be
                      hot?

            King reaches for the words - and takes the high road.

                                KING
                      Trent, the "criminal element" always
                      makes things hard for legitimate citizens
                      who are trying to do business.  
                          (a beat)
                      Didn't you find that to be so on Freeport
                      Station.

            This gets Trent's attention.

                                TRENT
                      How did you-?

                                KING
                      Juni told me.  She also said that you
                      might be interested in a little payback.

            King carefully chooses the last word - Payback.  Trent
            silently mouths it as a question.  The Camera creeps in on
            the conversation as it becomes more intimate. 

                                KING (CONT'D)
                          (sotto - quietly laying it out)
                      Trent, I have every reason to believe
                      that those criminals that we just fought
                      are linked to the Order and their
                      operation.  

            Trent makes the connection.

                                KING (CONT'D)
                      Now I think that any man who's been
                      wronged, has the right to justice - to
                      even extract compensation, if you take my
                      meaning.  

            Trent nods, chewing on this.

                                KING (CONT'D)
                      Right now those criminals - maybe even
                      the same criminals who took your goods
                      and landed you in Liberty -- are hiding
                      out there in the debris field...waiting
                      for you to collect on their heads.
                          (a beat)
                      Are you with me? 

            ANGLE ON: Trent brewing. 

                                TRENT
                          (finally)
                      I'm in.

            King smiles and raises his glass - Trent does the same -
            clink.

                      The Washington crime wave continues - as
                      a recent harassment of a convoy to
                      Pittsburgh will attest.  In each case,
                      pilots have had their cargo holds
                      repeatedly scanned by these criminals
                      during the attacks.  Authorities say that
                      these perpetrators simply appear to be
                      very selective of their targets,
                      dismissing earlier speculation that they
                      might actually be looking for a specific
                      class of cargo; denying any hard evidence
                      of a connection.

            MISSION TWO

            See Mission Pack. 

            A1RTC10RUMOR5 - INT. PITTSBURGH BAR

            The bar is full of patrons and the music plays.  King, who
            has had a couple of drinks, sits with a young blonde woman,
            AVICA and her brunette friend, DMITRA.  They are both lithe
            and stunning.  Trent recognizes him and walks over, puzzled
            by the circus scene.  King stands and applauds broadly and
            loudly, putting the smouldering cigar between his teeth as he
            talks.  

            He walks up to Trent, leaving the two girls to watch after
            him.

                                KING
                      There he is.  - Felt good didn't it.

            The adrenaline of the room washes over him - damn right it
            felt good.

                                TRENT
                      Yeah!

                                KING
                      I think Juni did us both a favor today. 
                      And now..
                          (re: the two girls )
                      Behind me, my friend are two fans of your
                      handiwork - who have been dying to meet
                      you-

            Trent tries to get a glimpse of them over King's back.  King
            intervenes and turns Trent away from them - with an arm
            around his neck.  The girls watch this display, laughing. 
            They know the game. 

                                KING (CONT'D)
                          (playfully)
                      Don't look right a way- what's wrong with
                      you?  You want to build their
                      expectation.

                                TRENT
                          (dawning on him)
                      Why me?

                                KING
                      Haven't you heard?  It's all over the
                      News -- "a decisive victory against the
                      pirate menace". 
                      That's your cherry loveletter to your
                      pirate pals.  Payback's a bitch.  
                      (a beat)
                      You've had a taste, now... 

            King turns with Trent and approaches the girls.

                                KING (CONT'D)
                          (walking to them with each
                           beat)
                       Enjoy it. Savor it.  

            He releases Trent, who sits with the girls - they welcome
            him.  Puffing his cigar for a moment, King surveys the scene. 
            The camera singles him out.

                                KING (CONT'D)
                          (more to himself)
                      Who says revenge isn't sweet?  

            He exits frame, joining the group.

                      Tragedy today as members of the Terrorist
                      organization: The Order - allegedly were
                      successful in an attack on the restricted
                      military installation, Zone 21, -
                      sabotaging a Naval Cruiser and killing
                      personnel, including an Admiral who was
                      visiting the site.  Officials have not
                      released the name of the Admiral nor the
                      servicemen killed in this cowardly act,
                      but do promise that they will take swift
                      action in response. 
                          (a beat)
                      Locally, however, a decisive victory
                      against the pirate menace near Pittsburgh
                      --as local militia and freelance pilots
                      delivered a crushing blow to criminals
                      who were, up until recently, threatening
                      local shipping and trade.  --Well done,
                      Boys!  

            MISSION THREE

            See Mission Pack. 

            A1RTC11A - EXT. MANHATTAN LANDING PAD

            The doors open and Trent gets out of his ship.  Something
            catches his attention on his fuselage and he runs a hand over
            it -- catching a glimpse of a man standing on the deck,
            watching him: Lonnigan. 

            ANGLE ON: Lonnigan far off, alone.

            Trent, remembering last time they met, begins to walk off the
            pad - hopefully without incident.

                                LONNIGAN
                          (calling after him)
                      You think you're safe, but you're not. 
                      None of us are.

            Trent stops, puzzled by this.  This guy is a loon.  He begins
            to walk again.  Lonnigan runs after him.  Trent looks over
            his shoulder and takes quick stock - no weapons, he ups the
            pace.  Lonnigan appears next to him walking, struggling to
            keep up.  Trent darts his eyes to him, then to his
            destination --anywhere but here.

                                LONNIGAN (CONT'D)
                      It's alright.  I'm better.  My name is
                      Doyle Lonnigan, I'm a commerce man, like
                      yourself...

            Shit.  He knows who Trent is.  Trent focuses on the end of
            the deck.  

                                LONNIGAN (CONT'D)
                      Why do you think they haven't released
                      the Freeport manifest.  They have it.  It
                      was the first thing they looked for.  

            Trent stops and turns.  This game's over.

                                TRENT
                          (firmly)
                      "They"?  "They" who?  Who is "they"?

                                LONNIGAN
                      Them.  The Government.  Big "T" -Them.

                                TRENT
                      You damn freak.  Of course the government
                      has the manifest, they're investigating
                      the disaster -

                                LONNIGAN
                          (twitching)
                      No!  It goes deeper than that.  There's
                      more.  There's -

            He stops dead in his tracks, eyes transfixed at something
            behind Trent's back.

            ANGLE: Over Trent's back - TWO LIBERTY ELITE GUARDS, stand
            waiting --eyes locked on the pair.  Lonnigan pales - starts
            to back away. Trent turns to see what he's looking at --
            Lonnigan suddenly bolts.

                                TRENT
                          (to Lonnigan)
                      Hey, wait!

            Trent turns back in time to see one of the Elite Guards
            brings a WEAPON to his shoulder and fire.

            A BLAST AND A SHARP WHIRRING SOUND fill the air.

            POV SMART DART: Sporadic and violent shifting of the frame as
            it travels at lightening speed.  The center is in focus as
            the outer edges smear to a blur.  It narrowly misses Trent,
            who ducks to avoid it out of reflex --and buries itself in
            the back of Lonnigan's neck.

            ANGLE ON: Lonnigan falling like a brick smokestack into
            camera.

            The two Guards push past the stunned Trent and pick up the
            prone Lonnigan.  On the way back they pass Trent again.

                                TRENT (CONT'D)
                      Hey, where are you --

            Trent doesn't get the last words out:  The other Elite Guard
            quickly pulls a STUN BATON and jams it into Trent's chest
            without a word.

            ANGLE ON: Trent lit up.  A moment later, he slips out of
            frame.

            SLO-MO: Trent hits the ground hard.  An echoy sound.  

            The two guards look down at him.  The now upright stun baton
            arcs again in frame, casting a white-blue pallor on the
            expressionless guards.

            ANGLE ON: Tight om Trent's unconscious face.  Two pairs of
            boots in the background walk off, dragging another.

                                                          FADE TO BLACK.

            OVER BLACK: Swirling sounds of water.  Waves.  Light rain.

                                JUNI (V.O.)
                          (softly and far away - like
                           having water in the ear)
                      Hey.

                                JUNI (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                          (closer)
                      Hey.

                                                 HORIZONTAL WIPE FROM THE
                                            CENTER - BOTH SIDES - LIKE AN
                                                         EYELID OPENING:

            A1RTC11B - EXT. MANHATTAN LANDING PAD

            TRENT'S POV - A shadowy image fills his vision.  It turns
            slowly.  Dreamily.  Watery.

            CLOSE ON: Trent's right eye also turning slowly.  Open,
            focusing.  A DRIP - SPLASH.  It shuts.  A few more.

                                TRENT
                      Ugh!

            WIDER SHOT: - He shakes his head and looks up.  Water beads
            on his face.

            TRENT's POV: Juni comes into focus.  A gentile rain is
            falling.

                                JUNI
                      Hey, are you alright?

            She helps him to sit up and he looks around bewildered, but
            almost glad to see her.  She is crouched at his side, where
            he finds he is sitting in water pooled on the deck.  Great.

                                TRENT
                          (pleased to see her)
                      Juni.
                          (slowly - realizing he's wet)
                      Yeah...

                                JUNI
                      What happened to you?

            Trent tries to recall.  

                                TRENT
                          (puzzled)
                      I don't know.

            Stun batons do a number on the noggin; scramble the neurons. 
            She helps him up - he's unsteady and a little bleary still.
            Camera rises with him.

                                JUNI
                      Well, you'd better pull yourself
                      together, I need you for this next
                      mission.
                          (sing song)
                      I can get you a jump drive...

            This rings his bell.

                                TRENT
                      A jump drive?

            She nods.

                                JUNI
                      You've done some good work Trent.  King's
                      reports have been excellent. 
                          (a beat)
                      You're good for business.

            He's a little stung that she puts it in these terms.

                                JUNI (CONT'D)
                          (picking up on it)
                      Don't get soft on me.  This is business,
                      alright?

                                TRENT
                          (back to reality)
                      Yeah... OK.

                                JUNI
                          (biz tone)
                      We've got a line on a smuggler who's been
                      moving artifacts in and out of Liberty
                      space - 

                                TRENT
                      What sort of artifacts?

                                JUNI
                      Alien, okay?  - Let me finish.

            He does.

                                JUNI (CONT'D)
                      Your job is to locate him and bring him
                      for interrogation.  Got it?

                                TRENT
                          (flatly)
                      I got it.

            She cocks her head.  IS he okay?

                                TRENT (CONT'D)
                      I got it.

            She nods and walks off.  Trent turns rubs his chest which
            suddenly hurts. Ouch!

                                JUNI (O.S.)
                          (an afterthought)
                      By the way your ass is wet.

            He turns to see her back - she's still walking and not
            waiting for a reaction.

            As he turns back - Lightning.  Or is it?

            FLASH!

            RUSH ZOOM up to Trent.  He sees something.

            FLASH!

            WHIP ZOOM - JUMP CUT to CLOSE SHOT of Syd watching him from
            across the deck.  He's seen the whole exchange with Juni.  

            FLASH!

            CLOSE ON: Trent's reaction.  All this cloak and dagger shit
            is getting on his nerves.  He starts to walk towards Syd. 
            Drawn to him. 

            A GROUP OF GUARDS in FORMATION moves between them, wiping
            frame...heads and bodies break up the scene.

            Trent tries to keep his eye on Syd as he walks closer.

            They pass.

            ANGLE ON: The place where Syd - WAS.  He's gone.

            Trent stops.  Is he going crazy?  He looks around on the
            deck.

            ANGLE ON: Trent from high above - craning up.  He continues
            to look around.  No Syd.

            A1RTC12RUMOR6 - INT. MANHATTAN BAR

            Trent walks up to the bar where WINSLOW, 50's - a Merchant of
            hard working Bretonian stock, is having a conversation with
            the Bartender.  Winslow looks him over.  

                                WINSLOW
                      Oh, Sonny-Jim - You look the way I feel.

            Even though Winslow and the Bartender laugh warmly, Trent
            still frowns.

                                WINSLOW (CONT'D)
                          (to the Bartender)
                      Oh, look at him...Barkeep - a drink for
                      this young lad --and another for -

            He holds up his glass and winks the end of his sentence.  The
            Bartender understands this -- like they all do and nods.  

                                WINSLOW (CONT'D)
                      Sorry, lad - we were just commiserating;
                      the Order just plundered a whole shipment
                      of machine parts that were bound to my
                      home port in Bretonia.  It's bad.  I've
                      never seen such bleedin' trouble like I
                      have now - even in Liberty.  
                          (a beat - then leaning in -
                           sotto)
                      Although, I understand it on good
                      authority that they weren't just after
                      that big bastard of a ship...that maybe
                      they were after your Admiral, himself. 
                      And if that's so...then you've got to ask
                      yourself why him?  What was he to them? 
                      And why was he out there?  
                      ...if you do that then you have to ask
                      yourself what Liberty is really up to in
                      that neck of the woods?

            He touches his finger to his head and winks as the drinks
            come.  He lightens his tone.

                                WINSLOW (CONT'D)
                          (to the Bartender)
                      Oh, Doctor - you are just the man I was
                      hopin' to see.  
                          (to Trent)
                      Here's cheers.

            He drinks with a wink and a nod -- meaning so much more.

            KEIKO, A FEMALE KUSARI MERCHANT, 20's, sits at a corner
            table.  She carefully eyes Trent as he walks up.

                                KEIKO
                          (candid)
                      You look as if you're searching for
                      something more than a job.  Information,
                      perhaps?

            Trent nods.

                                KEIKO (CONT'D)
                      Hard to come by in the Capitol of
                      Liberty.  Perhaps your looking in the
                      wrong place...Luckily, news travels more
                      freely elsewhere.
                          (a beat)
                      You have heard that Rheinland recently
                      discovered a planet, rich with objects
                      from a civilization that predated even
                      SOL...

                                TRENT
                      No, I hadn't...but artifacts aren't any
                      big secret.  You see them all the time.

            She nods.

                                KEIKO
                      Many of the artifacts that are on the
                      market are found in the Nebulas and
                      outlying regions by the miners.  They are
                      amusing trinkets only.  Art.  I sell them
                      myself...or at least I will until Liberty
                      restricts their sale.

                                TRENT
                      What?

                                KEIKO
                      They'll be considered contraband...

            Off Trent's look.

                                KEIKO (CONT'D)
                      Liberty has issued orders for all of us
                      to surrender our artifacts for inspection
                      and impound.  They say it's temporary,
                      but...

                                TRENT
                      How can they do that?

                                KEIKO
                      The question is not "How?", but "Why?"

                      And from the President's Office earlier
                      today, the announcement of a new
                      initiative against piracy and smuggling. 
                      Local Merchants voiced strong support of
                      new stiffer penalties and reward policies
                      for information leading to the capture
                      and prosecution of criminals; claiming it
                      as a victory against increased pirate
                      activity in Liberty space and allegations
                      of the Order's link to organized crime.
                      The President also decried the Order's
                      recent attack of a routine military
                      flight to Colorado - an attack which left
                      General Walter Evans and his escort dead.    
                      In related news, Liberty Command says
                      that it has redoubled its efforts to
                      identify the Order's leader, only known
                      as Orillion.  Earlier attempts, thus far
                      have failed, but officials remain
                      positive and ask for the continued
                      support of citizens to report any
                      suspicious activities at once.

            PEOPLE with jobs to do hustle on the deck.  Through them
            Juni, flanked by two Elite Guards, emerge and watch the
            incoming ship.

            The ship settles and Trent exits through the hatchway.  Juni
            is impressed, but still restrained.  The Guards shift
            expectantly. 

                                JUNI
                      I must admit, Trent, you had me
                      worried...your methods are--inventive. 

                                TRENT
                          (re: the Guards - and Ashcroft)
                      Are you sure you brought enough men? 
                      He's unconscious.

                                JUNI
                      Trent, Ashcroft is a dangerous man. I
                      like a sure thing.

            She snaps her fingers and the men brush past Trent and to his
            hold.  He watches them pass him.  She watches him --yes, she
            is impressed.

                                JUNI (CONT'D)
                          (quietly - almost coyly)
                       ...and a sure thing is hard to find.

            He catches this but she moves on quickly though.

                                JUNI (CONT'D)
                      Which reminds me - the bounty...I owe you
                      this.

            Cash appears in his register.

                                JUNI (CONT'D)
                      But there is something else... 

            She takes him by the arm and walks. 

                                TRENT
                      There is?

            She nods and leads him to the equipment cart.  In the bg, the
            Guards drag off a freshly-worked over SEAN ASHCROFT, 30's,
            bad hair, no chin. Trent doesn't see.

                                JUNI
                      It seems to me I also promised you a jump
                      drive.  Well, never let it be said that I
                      don't pay off.  

            She indicates the apparatus on the cart.  Trent is pleasantly
            surprised and looks like a man after a long cool drink.

                                TRENT
                      This is great.  I'm back.

                                JUNI
                      With this - the Bounty on Ashcroft and
                      your new clearance rating, I expect
                      you'll be occupied for a while  - while
                      I'm gone.

                                TRENT
                      Gone?

                                JUNI
                      On assignment.  I take orders, too,
                      Trent. 

            She gets close.  Very close.  She smiles.

                                JUNI (CONT'D)
                      But don't go too far - I might need you
                      sometime -- soon.

            She brushes past him close enough for him to smell her hair.

            FREE TIME

            Player can take on missions, etc.

            Later - whenever he returns to Manhattan: 

            A1RTC15RUMOR8 - INT. MANHATTAN LANDING PAD (PLAYS)

            Trent gets out of his ship, with his newly installed
            jumpdrive.  He's still pretty up.

            ANGLE ON: close Trent.  Yeah, he's back alright.  A step
            closer to rebuilding his life.  As he takes a few steps along
            his ship, an arm comes down around his neck from behind. 
            Trent struggles - but stops when he feels the long EVIL BLADE
            take its place at his throat.

            Camera WIDENS to allow just Lonnigan's face.  They struggle a
            bit.

                                LONNIGAN
                      Don't move.  I swear I'll cut you open
                      like a fish.  Just listen to me!

            Trent does what he says, partly recognizing the voice - but
            mostly being caught in the iron grip of a crazy person.

                                LONNIGAN (CONT'D)
                      I came back to warn you.  You're not
                      safe.  None of us are.  Something is
                      going on in Liberty.  

            Trent moves.  Lonnigan redoubles his efforts. There is a
            trickle of blood at Trent's neck.

                                LONNIGAN (CONT'D)
                      Stay still!  Freeport Station?  Zone 21?
                      Don't you see?  There's a connection. 
                      Liberty and the artifacts?  Dammit, I'm
                      trying to help you.

                                TRENT
                      Lonnigan, look just put the knife down. 
                      You're still sick from the attack.  I can
                      help you.

                                LONNIGAN
                          (calmly)
                      I don't need your help, Trent.  I know
                      what I'm doing.  This is your last chance
                      to get out of Liberty.  Be warned. 

            Lonnigan pitches him forward.  When Trent recovers his
            footing and spins - Lonnigan is gone.

                      President Jacobi announced today that
                      Liberty will be enforcing a ban on all
                      artifact trading - effective immediately. 
                      Citing Presidential perrogatives in times
                      of Emergency - and taking no further
                      questions - she indicated that new
                      information had surfaced making Artifacts
                      a dangerous class of elements to be owned
                      or traded within the ranks of ordinary
                      citizenry.  Local Merchants, who had
                      previously given their support to her,
                      were puzzled by this move.  One who
                      spoke, on the condition of their
                      anonymity, said that there might be a
                      connection between this action and a
                      recent wave of black market artifacts
                      from Rheinland.  There has been no
                      evidence as of yet to support or refute
                      this claim.

                      eye-witnesses, overwhelming evidence
                      suggests that these pirates might have
                      been acting on behalf of the Kusari - an
                      uncalled for action that could demand
                      retribution.  
                      A spokesman for the Shogun flatly denied
                      these allegations and requested a formal
                      apology from the Chancellor. 

            A1RTC16RUMOR9 - INT. ANY LIBERTY COMMODITY TRADER ROOM

            LEV, A YOUNG APPRENTICE COMMODITY TRADER, stands nearby. 
            Trent approaches him. 

                                LEV
                      Listen, friend - it's none of my business
                      but be careful around the border. 
                      There's been a rash of smuggling since
                      Liberty started banning the Artifact
                      Trade and this has caused the already
                      twitchy Elite Guard to be a little heavy
                      handed.  Makes it hard for the innocent
                      to stay innocent if you take my meaning.

            A1RTC17RUMOR10 - INT. ANY LIBERTY BAR

            QUINN, 30 and leathery looking, an Agent for the Gas Miner's
            Guild, checks out Trent as he approaches.

                                QUINN
                      You may want to consider doing some work
                      for the Guild in the future...our trade
                      is still strong.  

            He laughs.

                                QUINN (CONT'D)
                      We now even have a deal with Liberty to
                      directly buy up the Artifacts we find in
                      the refining process.  Oracle Lorenz
                      smells fear...and desperation.  A
                      combination that makes bargaining with
                      them all the better. 

            A1RTC18 - INT. CALIFORNIA OUTPOST BAR - LATER (AFTER JUNI'S
            COMM IN SPACE) 

            Trent wanders into the bar - it's filled with the usual type
            of crowd but a little rougher around the edges. 
            It's not wild exactly, but they dress a little differently
            and are less subdued than their Manhattan brethren.  Trent
            sees Juni, who raises a drink at him.  She looks smooth in
            the corner, easily fitting into this crowd.  Trent has a
            seat. Sound of the din. 

                                TRENT
                      If you'd wanted to see me you could have
                      picked a quieter place.

            She smiles - jab.

                                JUNI
                      I like to keep a low profile. 

            Trent glances around - a small scuffle breaks out.  Sound of
            breaking glass.

                                TRENT
                      Well, this is low -- I'll give you that.

                                JUNI
                      The reason I called you here, Trent,
                      apart from your glittering social
                      commentary is to have you do a job.

                                TRENT
                      I'm listening.

                                JUNI
                      Ashcroft's interrogation was fruitful -
                      it's given us a whole new perspective on
                      the inner workings of the artifact
                      smuggling ring that's been operating in
                      Liberty. 
                          ( a beat)
                      and there's something else...

            Off Trent's look. 

                                JUNI (CONT'D)
                      There's someone working on the inside in
                      Liberty.

                                TRENT
                      Who?  On what level?

            She shakes her head.

                                JUNI
                      We don't know for sure yet.  We think it
                      may be in the Navy, itself.  An officer
                      perhaps. 
                      In any event, on the strength of
                      Ashcroft's confession, my superior has
                      ordered an operation to try and expose
                      this traitor at any cost.  Will you help?

                                TRENT
                      When do I leave?

                                JUNI
                      We.  When do we leave?  I'm under orders
                      too, Trent.  We're working together on
                      this one.

            His eyes widen.

                                TRENT
                      Together.  That could prove to be
                      interesting.  I get to see you in action.

                                JUNI
                      You won't see much if you don't keep up. 
                      Meanwhile, play your cards right and you
                      might get a better jump drive out of the
                      deal...

                                TRENT
                      Heh, I --

            Trent happens to glance up and see the News - where a picture
            of Lonnigan fills the screen.  He freezes and focuses in on
            it.  He gets up -

                                JUNI
                      Hey-!

                                TRENT
                      Shhh.

            ANGLE DOWN ON: Trent approaching the News Monitor, followed
            by Juni.  Trent (and we) can hear it now.

            REVERSE:  On the monitor...

                                LIBERTY NEWSCASTER (V.O.)
                      ....ending the weeks of fear and
                      apprehension....Again, after an
                      exhaustive manhunt, the leader of the
                      Order, the man known only as Orillion,
                      was shot and killed while trying to
                      escape into Rheinland space.  

            Trent looks at this in disbelief.

                                LIBERTY NEWSCASTER (CONT'D)
                      Liberty Officials have just released his
                      real name --

            Trent and the Newscaster say it together.

                                TRENT/NEWSCASTER (V.O.)
                      Doyle Lonnigan.

            Juni looks at Trent as the rest of the Newscast becomes a bg
            rumble.

                                JUNI
                      How did you know that?

                                TRENT
                      He jumped me -- on Manhattan.  He said
                      that Liberty was out to get him.

                                JUNI
                      I'd say he was that he was telling the
                      truth about that.

            They both look back up at the monitor.  The picture of
            Lonnigan in happier times, standing with a felled Bretonian
            Elk, grins back at him. 

                                LIBERTY NEWSCASTER (V.O.)
                      For those just joining us - Doyle
                      Lonnigan, apparently a man of many names -
                      the most recent being Orillion, the
                      odious leader of the terrorist group: The
                      Order.  Now, justly dispatched by
                      peacekeeping forces at the Liberty Border
                      after a bloody shoot-out.  The badly
                      mutilated remains are in Liberty custody
                      and are under guard, pending autopsy. 

            Trent looks into his eyes.  He looks too stupid to have been
            this good.  Juni is tired of this.

                                JUNI
                      Well, you should feel pretty good:  You
                      went two rounds with a traitorous
                      criminal...you survived and he's a stain. 
                      Serves the bastard right.
                          (a beat)
                      C'mon, Trent, we've got another scumbag
                      to ferret out.

            She walks off.  Trent slowly turns and follows, still shaken.

            MISSION FIVE

            See Mission Pack.

            A1RTC19 - INT. MINING PLANET RUSHMORE BAR

            If the bar that Trent was in earlier were a gutter, this one
            would be the sewer; mining planets tend to attract a wild and
            filthy crowd, hungry for every sort of diversion.

            Trent and Juni walk in and find a table.

                                JUNI
                      So, here's where we lay low for a while.

                                TRENT
                      Cozy.  Reminds me of home.

                                WALKER (O.S.)
                      Only if you were raised by wolves, Mr.
                      Trent.

            Trent and Juni look up and see, MARCUS WALKER, 30's, blonde,
            handsome with a small mustache; almost be heroic in a classic
            sense.

                                WALKER (CONT'D)
                      But then again, I read your dossier.

            They laugh politely, though he and Trent clearly throw
            sparks.

                                JUNI
                          (pleased to see him)
                      Marcus, sit down - I'll get some drinks.

            She gets up and walks up to him.

                                JUNI (CONT'D)
                      You can get to know Trent a little
                      better.

            Unconsciously, she puts her hand on Marcus' shoulder.

            ANGLE ON: Trent noticing this.

            ANGLE ON: Juni's hand on his shoulder.  In response, Walker
            deftly pats hers as he speaks.

            TIGHTER ON: Trent.  They know each other --too well.

                                WALKER
                          (re: Trent - a hint of not
                           digging this, but pleasant for
                           her sake)
                      Fine. After all you've told me about him. 
                      I can hardly wait.

            Smiling, she leaves.  Walker looks after her, then-

                                WALKER (CONT'D)
                          (to Trent - direct)
                      What do you say we cut to the chase, Mr.
                      Trent?

                                TRENT
                      Suits me fine.

            Walker sits.

                                WALKER
                      Your the kind of animal I can't stand,
                      Mr. Trent: undisciplined, insubordinate,
                      ethically ambivalent...

                                TRENT
                      Anything else?

                                WALKER
                      Yes - You fly by the seat of your pants,
                      your methods and loyalties are highly
                      suspect and frankly, I have no idea what
                      Juni sees in you.

            After a moment.

                                TRENT
                      I do.

                                WALKER
                      Really...Perhaps you'd like to share it
                      with me...

                                TRENT
                      Okay.  It's simple.  You look good,
                      Walker, and you've come pretty far --but
                      now your stuck.  The Order, the traitor
                      in Liberty, the recent assassinations --
                      you don't really have a clue what's going
                      on, do you?

                                WALKER
                      Oh, and I suppose you do.

            Trent shrugs.

                                TRENT
                      The plain truth is the climate has
                      changed - and you're the dinosaur,
                      Walker.  Juni likes me because I deliver. 
                      I can adapt.  And you with all of your
                      pathetic, milquetoast mincing around are
                      nothing but a --- bureaucrat. 

            Walker is silent --red faced, furious.  Trent is solid but
            relaxed.  Juni appears with drinks and sees the two men
            locking horns. This is more than professional competition.   

                                JUNI
                          (apprehensive - sensing
                           something)
                      How are things here?

            A moment of tension.  Mercifully, there is yelling elsewhere
            in the bar.  The crowd is hushed by the GRUFF BARTENDER as
            the News comes on.  Even Trent, Juni and Walker look over.

                                GRUFF BARTENDER
                      Hey!  HEY!!  Quiet down, you mugs!  This
                      may be important.

            The News plays, the room dims slightly. Shots of various
            dignitaries, places, ships.

                                LIBERTY NEWSCASTER (V.O.)
                      Today is a day of mourning in the
                      Colonies as Karl Ettinger, the Chancellor
                      of Rheinland, died yesterday in an
                      explosion that also claimed the lives of
                      his personal crew and the entire
                      battleship group that was escorting him. 
                      Authorities said they were to inspect the
                      remains of the destroyed Hamburg station
                      when the fusion bomb that was planted
                      among them detonated.  Rheinland Citizens
                      were horrified at this news and the
                      Kaiser himself reacted with venom,
                      stating that the Kusari were to blame for
                      the atrocity.  Despite repeated denials
                      and official condolences from the
                      Shogunate, the Kaiser swiftly mobilized
                      what can only be described as a military
                      buildup around his borders - particularly
                      those shared with the Kusari. 
                      The Kusari have reacted with astonishment
                      at this and have taken a defensive
                      stance, registering a protest with the
                      Colonial High Court. At home - the
                      President indicated her sadness at the
                      news of the Chancellor's death but also
                      cautioned the Kaiser that his actions
                      bordered on violation of the Boorman
                      Treaty, forbidding such direct actions
                      against other governments.  She was
                      joined by Lord Quigley of Bretonia, in
                      proposing an emergency summit meeting to
                      hear and settle the grievances of the two
                      sister Colonies.  No word yet from the
                      Kaiser on this matter.

            The lights come up.  Leaving the group speechless.  Some
            murmuring creeps in, as Walker gets up suddenly. 

                                WALKER
                          (to Juni)
                      Juni, I'm going to have to go.  I just
                      came to tell you that our informant has
                      passed us the location of the smuggling
                      ring's operation.  I've brought a crack
                      team in to take them down, but I also
                      need you to come with us to help punch
                      our way in and get them all.

                                JUNI
                      You mean - both of us.  Trent, too.
                          (to Trent)
                      Right?

            He looks hard at Trent.  Their eyes meet.

                                TRENT
                      I wouldn't miss it.

                                WALKER
                          (slowly dealing with it -
                           stung)
                      Of course...Mr. Trent is vital to the
                      success of this operation.  
                          (to Juni)
                      Your words, I think.
                          (a beat)
                      See you at the rendezvous.

            He spits the word vital out like poison, then leaves -
            curtly.  She looks after him.  Finally.

                                JUNI
                      What did you and he talk about?

                                TRENT
                      Natural Selection.

            She cocks her head, chewing on this.  Trent drinks.

                                LIBERTY COMMODITY TRADER
                      Have you been keeping up with this
                      business between Rheinland and Kusari? 
                      The President had better do something -
                      and fast.

                                TRENT
                      Is it affecting Trade?

                                LIBERTY COMMODITY TRADER
                      Of course it is...but what worries me is
                      that this is the first time since the
                      foundation of the Sirius Colonies that
                      we've come so close to a major conflict. 
                      It's what drove us out of SOL...and after
                      years of peace to think it could happen
                      again...

                      The Summit meeting spearheaded by
                      President Jacobi and Lord Quigley,
                      Foreign Minister of Bretonia, is moving

                      though the Rheinland Chancellor's office
                      has refused to comment at this time, they
                      and the Kusari have agreed to attend and

            Trent finds a FEMALE LIBERTY MERCHANT at a booth.

                                FEMALE LIBERTY MERCHANT
                      I tell you this all started with
                      Rheinland finding that damn planetoid. 
                      They're hoarding all of the rich science
                      stuff for themselves, not to mention
                      anything else they may have found -- I
                      have it on good authority that it has a
                      core made of pure gold.  That's what this
                      is all about -- good, ol' fashioned
                      greed.  

            A1RTC22RUMOR13 - INT. ANY LIBERTY BAR

            Trent finds a KARL HEINZ, 40's, A PLEASANT, BURLY RHEINLAND
            MERCHANT at a table.

                                KARL HEINZ
                      I can't understand what's going on in
                      Rheinland.  I've been on assignment here
                      for the last several years so I've got
                      many friends, but I feel like I've been
                      cut off from my home.  I can't find some
                      of the people I used to - good people,
                      influential people to tell me what's
                      going on in the government.  I can't
                      understand what the Kaiser is doing -- he
                      seems preoccupied with this Kusari
                      problem and he's only making it worse. 
                      People there are afraid of what might
                      happen next..and I'm afraid for them.

            A1RTC23 - EXT. MANHATTAN LAUNCH PAD - LATER (AFTER JUNI'S
            COMM ABOUT WALKER'S DISAPPEARANCE) 

            The deck has several ships arranged in a pattern.  Trent
            lands in a natural space - set apart by the larger hulks 
            Juni is waiting along with a few TECH Guys with an equipment
            cart - who set to work on Trent's ship immediately like ants. 
            Trent steps out.  

                                JUNI
                      Trent, thanks for coming.

                                TRENT
                          (lightly jabbing)
                      To the victor goes the spoils...Had to -
                      you've got my jump drive.

            Trent sees that she's not up to her usual sparring form --she
            seems - preoccupied.  The wind blows extra hard on the deck.

                                TRENT (CONT'D)
                          (re: Walker..testing)
                      You've heard nothing from him yet.

                                JUNI
                      Not Walker, not any of them.  Something's
                      not right -

                                TRENT
                          (genuine)
                      What can we do?

            The techs step away from the ship and give her the thumbs up 
            - new drive is in place.  She gets her focus back.

                                 JUNI
                      We do our jobs.
                          (a beat - she sighs)
                      I'm going to finish my loadout. 

                                TRENT
                      I'll come with you-

                                JUNI
                          (plainly - icy)
                      What for?  Just make sure your ready. 

            She walks off with purpose.  

            ANGLE ON: Trent as he watches her go for a moment --he
            doesn't get her: Hot and Cold.  He turns and almost walks
            right into Syd, who is standing too close for comfort.  

                                TRENT
                          (surprised)
                      Argh! What is it with you guys?

                                SYD
                          (flatly)
                      I know why the station was attacked.

            Syd continues to stare at him.  He could be dangerous, but so
            is Trent -and he's tired of this game.  He walks to the nose
            of the ship, unafraid, and begins to inspect it.

                                TRENT
                      Yeah, so you keep saying.

            Syd follows Trent, eyes locked on him.  He stands a few feet
            away.

                                SYD
                      Mr. Trent, it's important that You and I
                      speak.

                                TRENT
                      Why?

                                SYD
                          (thrown off)
                      What?

                                TRENT
                      What is so important that you and I have
                      to talk about?  

            He takes steps towards Syd. Syd actually looks surprised. 

                                TRENT (CONT'D)
                          (getting angry)
                      If you have something say, say it.  No
                      more disappearing acts, no more spying on
                      me - no more sneaking around shit.  What? 
                      What is it?

            He's up in Syd's face now, glaring.

                                SYD
                      The reason it's important that you and I
                      speak, Mr. Trent, is because we are the
                      last two.

                                TRENT
                      Last two---?

                                SYD
                      Freeport Survivors.    

            This registers with Trent.

                                SYD (CONT'D)
                      You and I are the last ones in Liberty. 
                      Everyone else is either dead or
                      disappeared.  Poor Mr. Lonnigan was
                      number three.

            Trent backs off, but is now rationalizing.

                                TRENT
                      But Lonnigan was in with them -

            Syd just shakes his head.

                                SYD
                      He wasn't a terrorist, he was a
                      businessman - I knew him.  He was an
                      ordinary citizen whose only crime was
                      being in the wrong place at the wrong
                      time...Like us.

            He looks at Trent, who is taking this all in.  Trent swallows
            hard.

                                TRENT
                          (directly)
                      Why was the station destroyed?

                                SYD
                      They were looking for something.

                                TRENT
                      Who's they? - Lonnigan said it was the
                      government.

            Syd hears a noise and looks off screen.  He looks for a
            moment, so does Trent.  The array of equipment and ships has
            created a small enclave - where there are no people - they
            are alone.  Still, Syd moves Trent to a place under his ship,
            where they stand.

                                SYD
                      I don't know who they were, not yet.

                                TRENT
                      What were they looking for? Ore, weapons,
                      technology?

                                SYD
                      This.

            He reaches into his coat and pulls out the artifact. It glows
            - throwing a green caste on their faces.  Trent is
            mesmerized.  Off Trent's look - 

                                SYD (CONT'D)
                      It's an artifact, Mr. Trent.  A real one. 
                      This is the reason so many people have
                      died...

            ANGLE ON: The artifact, it glitters.

                                SYD (CONT'D)
                      I came by it in a salvage job.  Knew it
                      was special.  I came to Freeport to sell
                      it...at least have it valued.

            ANGLE ON: Trent.

                                TRENT
                      The manifest.

            Syd nods his head. 

                                SYD
                      They know I'm here.  They've been looking
                      for me.  That's why I had to find you.  
                      I --

            A small red dot appears on Syd's head as he speaks.  Trent
            reacts to this and Syd looks at him quizzically.

                                SYD (CONT'D)
                      What?

            Suddenly -

                                TRENT
                      GET DOWN -!

            Trent throws him down as several blasts hit the deck -
            missing Syd.

            When they both get up -they see Drake standing over them,
            moving closer.  His weapon poised.  He motions "hands up"
            with his muzzle.  They do it slowly, hesitantly.

                                DRAKE
                      I told you it was just a matter of time,
                      Mr. Trent.   I knew it was an inside job.
                       

            Trent rolls his eyes - and drops his hands a bit in disgust. 
            Drake zeroes in on him.

                                DRAKE (CONT'D)
                      Keep still, Mr. Trent.  You're worth more
                      to me alive, but I'm prepared to take the
                      loss.  

            Something get's Drake's attention.

                                DRAKE (CONT'D)
                      What's that?

            They look.

            ANGLE ON: The artifact on the deck.

            Silence. It becomes clear in Drake's mind.

                                DRAKE (CONT'D)
                      Oh, I see.  Terrorism and now smuggling. 
                          (a beat)
                      Kick it over here.

            A moment.  Nobody moves.

                                DRAKE (CONT'D)
                      Fine. 

            He moves them back with his gun and crouches down to pick it
            up...

                                SYD
                      NO!

            He lunges at Drake - BLAM!  Syd falls motionless.  Trent
            reacts but is met with Drake's aim.   Drakes demeanor changes
            - his expression is focused.  Drake slowly raises the gun -
            he doesn't want to miss.

                                TRENT
                      What are you doing?

                                DRAKE
                      I'm sorry, Mr. Trent - I can't afford you
                      any longer.

            Camera slowly pushes in as he is squeezes the trigger.

                                JUNI (O.S.)
                      LSO AGENT, FREEZE SOLDIER!

            They both look over and see Juni with her own weapon drawn -
            in an attack stance.

            Drake keeps his eye on Trent, but also recognizes Juni.

                                DRAKE
                      I caught this man trafficing in illegal
                      artifacts -

            She looks at Trent - who very slowly shakes his head - no.

                                JUNI
                          (coolly)
                      Then arrest him. 

                                TRENT
                      WHAT!?

                                DRAKE
                      I'm afraid I can't do that, ma'am.

                                JUNI
                      Soldier, you are bound by Liberty Code to
                      uphold the laws and statutes of the
                      colony.  You don't have a choice.  If
                      he's a suspect, take him into custody. 
                      The law protects him and ensures a fair
                      trial.

            The moment hangs in the air --as Drake narrows his eyes.

                                DRAKE
                      Not any more -

            He spins to shoot Juni.  She shoots first - two rounds --BANG
            BANG - they rip through Drake and he goes down.  Juni, is in
            shock, having been saved only by years of training. She
            stands there - with her gun still pointed.

                                JUNI
                      He was going to kill me.

                                TRENT
                          (his hands still up)
                      What do you mean "arrest him"?

            She approaches Drake and kicks away his weapon.  Gun still
            drawn.

                                JUNI
                      Shut up, Trent.  He was going to kill us
                      both.  Why?

            Nothing.

            She turns his gun on him.

                                JUNI (CONT'D)
                      Dammit. Why?!

                                TRENT
                          (solemn in the face of her gun)
                      I don't know.

            Finally, she backs off.  Syd catches her eye.

                                JUNI
                      Who's that?

            Trent goes to him and turns him over - he's dead.

                                TRENT
                      A friend...

            Trent get's up and walks over to the artifact.

            ANGLE ON: Artifact as he picks it up.

                                TRENT (CONT'D)
                      - He died a long time ago, but didn't
                      know it.

            He walks over to her.

                                TRENT (CONT'D)
                      Come on, we've got to go. Now.

                                JUNI
                      Are you crazy? 

                                TRENT
                          (re: Drake)
                      Are you?  You heard this man.  Walker,
                      the others, now this?  Something very
                      wrong is going on here - and like it or
                      not we're in the middle of it.  

            She considers this.

                                JUNI
                      --and the mission?

                                TRENT
                      Forget the mission.  We won't be any good
                      to anyone if we're dead.  And the only
                      way we were going to stay alive is with
                      some time and distance.

            This weighs heavily on Juni.  Finally.

                                JUNI
                      I know a place.

            MISSION 7

            See Mission Pack.

            A1RTC24 - INT. LIBERTY SCIENCE STATION BENFORD - LATER

            Juni and Trent land on the Station and are met by the
            scientist HERMAN VAN PELT, 70's, kindly with white hair.

                                VAN PELT
                      Jun'ko Crane, what's going on?  The
                      secure channel is buzzing with reports. 
                      They're after you?

                                JUNI
                      You don't believe everything you hear do
                      you?

            A moment - then a grin.

                                VAN PELT
                      You don't get to be my age if you do.

            He greets Juni warmly, clearly old friends.

                                JUNI
                      Good.  This is Trent.  He's okay.  We
                      just need a place to figure things out.

            Van Pelt and he exchange nods.  The walks with them.

                                VAN PELT
                      You've come to the right place - both of
                      you.  We don't get many visitors out
                      here.

                                TRENT
                      If you don't mind my asking what are you
                      doing this far out?

                                VAN PELT
                      We're studying the anomalies in the
                      badlands.  This station you see around
                      you was part of grand experiment to
                      harness their energies to fuel Liberty's
                      waning resources.  That was before they
                      relied so heavily on the Gas Mining
                      Guild, of course. 

                                TRENT
                      I never heard about that.

                                VAN PELT
                      Nor would you -- there was an accident. 
                      Liberty doesn't like to publicize its
                      failures, do you see?  Well, soon this
                      place was buried along with the dead.  It
                      still has some minor scientific value and
                      it is largely automated --except for me
                      of course. 

                                TRENT
                      You're here all alone? 

            He nods.

                                VAN PELT
                      Like it that way.  Not a lot of
                      distractions.

                                JUNI
                      Except us.

                                VAN PELT
                          (smiling)
                      Now Juni, I promised you father I'd look
                      after you.  Now I can finally make book
                      on that promise.

            They come to a console where the Secure Channel plays - It
            looks different than the News - more MP, same VO, though.

            LATER (PLAYS)

            Juni turns to Trent.

                                JUNI
                      They think I'm with the Order?  Me? 
                      Trent what have you done?

                                TRENT
                      Me?

                                JUNI
                      Who else?

            Van Pelt interrupts.  He sits, lighting his pipe.

                                VAN PELT
                      Juni, suppose you tell me what it is all
                      about?

            She looks at Trent and nods for him to pony up.

            He looks at Van Pelt and then back at her.

            She makes the same motion again - with more force.

            He reaches into his coat and pulls out --the Artifact.

            ANGLE ON: The artifact and Van Pelt's reaction.

                                VAN PELT (CONT'D)
                      I see.
                          (to Trent)
                      May I?

            Trent lets him hold it.

                                VAN PELT (CONT'D)
                      It's clearly an artifact but I've never
                      seen anything like it.  Where did you get
                      it?

                                TRENT
                      A scavenger on Manhattan.  He died
                      because of it.  So did a lot of other
                      people.

            Van Pelt looks at him and then at Juni.  She shrugs.  He
            starts to think and mutter to himself, puffing his pipe.

                                VAN PELT
                      Clearly
                      alien...ancient....superformation....rar
                      fied...nadnium crystal setting...still
                      active...hmmmmm.  Quintaine.

                                JUNI
                      What, Doctor?

                                VAN PELT
                      Professor Roland Quintaine... of
                      Bretonia.  I can't help you with this,
                      but maybe he can.  He's foremost in his
                      field.

                                TRENT
                      Bretonia?

                                VAN PELT
                      Yes.  Don't worry, Bretonia doesn't have
                      an artifact ban and the Secure Channel is
                      local.  You'll be safe there.  Now.  How
                      to get you there...

            Suddenly ALARMS FILL THE AIR.  They all jump up --Van Pelt
            checks the console. 

                                VAN PELT (CONT'D)
                      Long range shows a Liberty Patrol closing
                      in.

                                TRENT
                      So much for laying low.

                                JUNI
                      Hey! At least I'm doing something -

                                VAN PELT
                      Stop it both of you.

            He pushes some buttons.

                                VAN PELT (CONT'D)
                      I'm setting the automatic defense systems
                      to cover you - you've got to go.

                                JUNI
                      Go?  But go where?

            More buttons.

                                VAN PELT
                      One of the things that was left behind
                      here was a jumpgate to Bk1.  No one has
                      used it since the disaster, but it still
                      works.  It's deep in the badlands. I'm
                      loading up the coordinates.

            He takes her by the hand, running to her ship.  Trent
            follows.

                                JUNI
                      What about you?

                                VAN PELT
                      I'll be fine.  Go.

            Reluctantly she steps away, then hugs the old man.  

            Then goes without looking back.  Trent extends his hand.

            Van Pelt looks at it and then him.

                                TRENT
                      Thank you. 

            Van pelt takes his hand and shakes it.  

                                VAN PELT
                      Don't forget this.

            Trent's hand is filled with the artifact.  He looks at it. 

                                VAN PELT (CONT'D)
                          (re: Juni)
                      Take care of her, young man.

            Trent nods.

            They hit their ships.  As they lift off, Juni and Trent see
            the old man hold his hand up -- goodbye.

            They blast out of there.

            A2RTC1A - INT. LEEDS EQUIPMENT ROOM (PLAYS)

            Trent walks into the Equipment Room.  He sees the Equipment
            Dealer, RICHARD TOBIAS, 50, A LARGE WELSHMAN with a beard -
            Bretonia's answer to John Rhys-Davies.  He is finishing a
            transaction with a couple of other pilots.

                                TOBIAS
                      --you won't be sorry with that one, let
                      me tell you. 

            They seem satisfied as the transaction is complete and walk
            off.  Tobias, pleased with himself, turns and sees Trent --he
            stops dead for a minute, then strides past him.

                                TOBIAS (CONT'D)
                      I was wondering when you might show back
                      up here. 

            Tobias starts checking parts on the cart, his back to Trent.

            ANGLE ON: COMBO TWO SHOT of Tobias' expression and Trent's as
            they talk.

                                TOBIAS (CONT'D)
                      What are you..in some kind of trouble?

                                TRENT
                      You might say that.

            Tobias nods.

                                TOBIAS
                      Might I?  Might I also say "I told you
                      so?"

            Trent frowns and grinds his teeth.  Tobias turns.

                                TOBIAS (CONT'D)
                      I didn't take the time to apprentice you
                      so you could throw it all away.

            Trent sighs.

                                TOBIAS (CONT'D)
                      But you knew better.  "The deal of a
                      lifetime" you said.  Remember?  Eh?
                          (a beat)
                      And now look at you.  That you're Liberty
                      hunk of junk on the landing pad?

                                TRENT
                      Yeah.

            Tobias wipes his hands as he talks.  Walks right up to Trent.
            Looks him over a moment. 

                                TOBIAS
                          (softening - running out of
                           steam)
                      Hmmm.  I s'pose you'll be wanting some
                      new parts on that thing...

            A moment.

            Trent barely smiles.  These two have a lot of history. 
            Tobias grabs Trent - and hugs him like the big bear he is.

                                TOBIAS (CONT'D)
                      It's good to see you, boy.

            Trent is being crushed, put pats the very big man.  Tobias
            just as suddenly - releases him and wipes his nose.  Enough
            womanly emotions.  He clears his throat. Sniff.

                                TOBIAS (CONT'D)
                      So are you back now - for good?

                                TRENT
                      I've got a few things to clear up first - 

                                TOBIAS
                      This business gone bad?

            Trent nods.

                                TOBIAS (CONT'D)
                      How bad?

                                TRENT
                          (straight)
                      Very.  Some people are after me.

                                TOBIAS
                      I see.  
                          (rubbing his chin)
                      Well, you'll be needing something else -
                      something free and clear...  

                                                                 CUT TO:

            A2RTC1B - INT. LEEDS EQUIPMENT ROOM - ANTE ROOM/STORAGE

            Camera is tight on a remote control. Tobias pushes a button.

            Darkness inside a room - as two massive doors part.  Light
            spills in on a BRETONIAN SHIP.  Internal lights in the cellar
            like room kick in, illuminating the chamber and ship.

            REVERSE ON: Trent's reaction.  He stands out in the anteroom
            area, basically a storage place, set behind arches, girders
            and stairs --almost secret. 

                                TRENT
                      You still have it.

            Tobias enters and caresses the ship.  Trent follows.

                                TOBIAS
                      Damn right I do.  It's a classic.
                          (a beat - then a little
                           embarrassed - looking away)
                      I was saving it for you, boy.

            Trent is touched.  Tobias changes the tone - becoming the
            Dealer he is.

                                TOBIAS (CONT'D)
                      'Course, you'll have to transfer your
                      weapons and -

                                TRENT
                          (cutting him off - thank you)
                      It's beautiful.

            The older man smiles, having been basically told to stop
            covering.  He takes a few steps closer to Trent.

                                TOBIAS
                          (sotto - genuine - kind)
                      Look, whatever trouble you're in if you
                      need someone to watch your ass -

                                TRENT
                      I don't want to involve you.  This is my
                      problem.

            Tobias nods. Trent's his own man - he can respect that.

                                TOBIAS
                      If you change your mind, you'll know
                      where I'll be -

            Trent finishes for him as if he's heard it a thousand times.

                                TRENT
                      -the shop or the pub.

            Tobias winks.  

                                TOBIAS
                          (gently)
                      That's right.

                                BRETONIAN NEWSCASTER (V.O.)
                      In Liberty, the Undersecretary of
                      Security, James Ballenshine, died
                      unexpectedly in his office of what a
                      Liberty spokesperson called natural
                      causes.  He was pronounced dead at the
                      scene and his body was removed to the
                      government medical unit for closer
                      examination to better determine the
                      official cause of death, though foul play
                      has been ruled out as a factor at this
                      time.  President Jacobi of Liberty,
                      soberly and with great respect offered
                      her personal, deepest sympathies to the
                      Undersecretary's family but also added
                      that his passing would not diminish
                      Liberty's commitment to the peace process
                      elsewhere in the Colonies.  Furthermore,
                      she announced that she will be attending
                      the Summit meeting in New Geneva herself
                      in the late Undersecretaries stead.

            Trent walks up to a MALE BRETONIAN FIGHTER PILOT -
            (FREELANCER).  Like Trent, he's hired help - so he has inside
            info and an attitude.  He has an easy demeanor about him like
            he carries his share of scars, hidden by his tunic.

                                BRETONIAN FREELANCER
                      Just came back from the Borderworlds.  If
                      you're planning on taking any work out
                      that way --watch out: Rheinland's set out
                      a ton of hardware...They're crossing the
                      line on this one -and they don't care
                      whose beer they piss in...  I think they
                      mean it this time.  It could be war.

            A2RTC3 - CAMBRIDGE LANDING PAD - NIGHT

            Pools of light as Trent lands his ship.  Though the city is
            lit and there is some action - it's distant.  It's overcast -
            foggy and pretty dead on the pad --eerily so.  Trent gets out
            of his ship and looks around.  As he starts to walk -  

                                JUNI (O.S.)
                      I was wondering when you'd show.

            Trent looks into the inky darkness to where the voice came
            from.

            CAMERA - WHIP PAN to Juni coming out of the shadows and into
            the light.

                                JUNI (CONT'D)
                      It's not like this place is a hotbed of
                      activity, you know.

            Trent meets her in the light.  Footsteps on a wet deck.

                                TRENT
                      Well, at least you didn't have a bounty
                      hunter after you.

                                JUNI
                      Ha! The hell I didn't --right after we
                      split up.  He wasn't much of a challenge,
                      though.

            She smiles the way a panther does after ripping the throat
            out of a gazelle.  Trent let's it slide - perhaps he was more
            challenged in his fight...In any case, he changes the
            subject.

                                TRENT
                      Did you find Quintaine?

            She sighs.

                                JUNI
                      That's another thing: The good doctor has
                      disappeared.

                                TRENT
                      Like the others?

                                JUNI
                      Don't know.  He's just not here.

                                TRENT
                      Well, we've got to find him.  We need
                      someone to identify this damn thing.

            He holds up the artifact.  She looks at it - sets her off.

                                JUNI
                          (a little agitated)
                      No shit, Sherlock.  Why do you think I've
                      been creeping around limeytown here
                      looking for a musty old geezer with an IQ
                      bigger than his fingers and toes?
                          (a beat - a little cooler)
                      I had a good commission in Manhattan. 
                      What the hell am I doing here?

            Trent doesn't have an answer.

                                TRENT
                      Juni, I -

                                JUNI
                      Give it here.

            She snatches the artifact away from Trent.

                                JUNI (CONT'D)
                      Maybe I can cover more ground.

                                TRENT
                      Hey -

            Before he can protest, she walks off into the night.  She
            sways through the pools of light and dark as Trent calls
            after her.

                                TRENT (CONT'D)
                          (calling)
                      You'll take care of that, right?

            Still walking away - light/dark.

                                JUNI
                      Shut up. Go make some money.  We'll need
                      it.

                                TRENT
                          (calling farther)
                      You are coming back aren't you?

                                JUNI
                          (far off)
                      Where would I go.

            Pretty soon Trent is alone.  He looks into the city and takes
            a breath.  Where to begin...?

                      The ongoing Rheinland blockade of the
                      jump gates in Epsilon-Chi continue to
                      cause outrage throughout the Colonies. 
                      The Crown and other leaders called for
                      the Kaiser to withdraw his forces that
                      are constricting trade and other traffic
                      in that area.  Rheinland has not
                      responded - by word or action, casting a
                      shadow of doubt on the upcoming Summit
                      meeting in New Geneva.

            Trent approaches a FEMALE BRETONIAN MERCHANT, young,
            conservative and a supporter of the Crown, sitting at a
            table. 

                                FEMALE BRETONIAN MERCHANT
                      I had some business abroad in Hamburg
                      yesterday - everyone was buzzing about
                      the news of the draft.  Have you heard? 

            Trent shakes his head - no.

                                FEMALE BRETONIAN MERCHANT (CONT'D)
                      It's true.  The Kaiser's called all able
                      bodied men and women to government
                      service...Some are going because they
                      have to but some because they believe in
                      it.  I hope Lord Quigley and the others
                      can make them see reason before it's too
                      late.

            A2RTC5RUMOR3 - ANY BRETONIA PUB

            MAHLER, a Bretonian Ore Runner, mid-thirties and a little
            rough, sits with a group of several OTHERS of his profession,
            including a TATTOOED GIRL with a Mohawk, DIAMONDBACK. They
            are a cross between high steel workers and stunt men - a
            unique group that keeps their own company; swapping stories
            in an entertaining display of one-up-manship that is for lack
            of a better word - exclusive.  

            Trent bellies up to the bar and overhears their conversation,
            a tangle of walla that is beaten down by Mahler in mid
            stride.

                                MAHLER
                          (to his lot)
                      --Nahh...his signature was "different"-
                      and his markings -  

                                DIAMONDBACK
                      You saw him?

                                MAHLER
                      With me own eyes.

                                ORE RUNNER 1
                      What you saw was a trick o' the senses. 
                      What little sense ya' have -

            The table erupts with laughter.

                                DIAMONDBACK
                      Too much rum...Ha!

                                ORE RUNNER 2
                          (genuine - quiets the group)
                      Now..now...I think our brother Mahler
                      coulda seen what he says he saw...

            Mahler raises his glass -at last, some respect.

                                ORE RUNNER 2 (CONT'D)
                          (drops the hammer - hokey)
                      Yes, indeed...coulda been one o' them
                      'Sperimental Rheinlan' ships...all
                      Secret..and shiny.  Boo!

            He laughs and the table howls in response.  Mahler pulls his
            hat down in disgust and shoots them all an obscene gesture
            (known only to them, but we get it).  It only makes them jeer
            more.

                                MAHLER
                      You're all jacked in the head, you know. 
                      What I saw was like nothin' I'd ever seen
                      -- it swallowed the stars, it did.  Moved
                      like water.  Then it was gone.  It was--

            SUDDENLY - A BLUR -- WHOOSH!  

            CLOSE SHOT ANGLED UP AT: Trent - THUD-DLLLLLL- an intricately
            carved GMG dagger hits the edge of the bar a couple of feet
            from Trent.  His eyes lock on it with surprise - but he is a
            still life in cool.  The blade sharply vibrates in the
            foreground.  Trent slowly rolls his eyes back to the table
            where Mahler sits.  

            The Pub is silent.

            The ENTIRE group is now glaring at Trent, especially Mahler,
            who's hand is still extended from the lightning-fast throw. 
            He sucks his teeth, in defiance and disgust. 

                                MAHLER (CONT'D)
                          (low - threatening)
                      Mind your own business.  Lessen you want
                      me to hand you your lungs?

            Trent sizes them up with his eyes, considering the odds.  The
            BRETONIAN BARTENDER, 50, moustache, seen it all, leans in.

                                BRETONIAN BARTENDER
                          (sotto)
                      Best to let that one go, laddie.

            A moment.  Trent puts his hands up and makes a small face. 
            This one will pass.  The pub gets back in gear, used to this
            kind of thing.  He turns back to the bar.  The Tattooed Girl
            steps up to retrieve the knife.

                                DIAMONDBACK (O.S.)
                      You're a smart one.  I've seen him rip a
                      man from his neck to his nuts and show
                      him his beatin' heart.

            Trent turns to take in her scenery.  She pulls the knife free
            and stuffs it into her own bodice.  She's wild, sexy and
            intense...Mohawk and all.

                                DIAMONDBACK (CONT'D)
                      Name's Diamondback.  Mahler, there, has a
                      tenancy to hand uninvited ears back their
                      uninvited owners.

                                TRENT
                      What about you?

                                DIAMONDBACK
                      The same -- but different. He's just
                      extra short about his Nomad story.

                                TRENT
                      Nomad?

                                DIAMONDBACK
                      That's what he calls it.  His mystery
                      ship...His big fish that got away. 

            She shoots Mahler a glance as she says this.  Mahler is too
            busy drinking to notice.

                                DIAMONDBACK (CONT'D)
                      We give him his due o' shite, but others
                      have seen 'em too.  Some not as lucky as
                      him...they didn't come back.

                                TRENT
                      Have you seen them?

                                DIAMONDBACK
                      Naw.  And I go out pretty far.

            Trent seems interested in them...

                                DIAMONDBACK (CONT'D)
                      And if you're thinkin' 'bout doin'
                      somethin' stupid like searchin' 'em out. 
                      I hope you show the same sense you showed
                      here today...

            She leans into Trent and whispers in his ear.  She has animal 
            magnetism.

            ANGLE: ECU - CLOSE of Diamondback and his ear.  Her mouth.

                                DIAMONDBACK (CONT'D)
                      Leave it alone, stud.  It'd be a waste o'
                      good flesh.

            She bites his earlobe and pulls back smiling, looking
            somewhat devilish.  Trent smiles back - blood pressure
            soaring, but stays reserved.

                                TRENT
                      I'll take it under advisement.

            She nods a conciliatory gesture, still smiling - she walks
            away, her penetrating eyes on Trent.  Finally, he turns to
            the bar and looks at the Bretonian Bartender, who winks and
            gently laughs, cleaning a glass.  Trent exhales and raises
            his eyebrows to himself.  It's been a day.

                      This just in, Bretonia and the Colonies
                      suffered an anguishing loss as Lord
                      Arnold Benson Quigley, Foreign Minister
                      to the Crown of Bretonia, was brutally
                      assassinated in his home.  This is a

                      him, and for those who loved peace.  The

                      Investigating authorities have swarmed

            Trent sees a MALE LIBERTY MERCHANT sitting in the crowded
            Bretonian pub.  He sits like Pacino, with a glass of whiskey
            on the table, gesturing animatedly as he speaks to Trent.

                                MALE LIBERTY MERCHANT
                          (agitated and animated - volume
                           turned up to 11)
                      Oh, Christ, this place is headed for the
                      crapper now.   The one man --and I mean
                      one man - who's only goal was
                      peace...who's only thought was to stop a
                      great injustice, who wasn't interested in
                      lining his pockets with the melted down
                      dental gold ripped from the mouths of the
                      dead, sacrificed in an unholy war....they
                      put a gun in his mouth and blammo!  Now
                      he's dog meat.

            He makes the gun gesture with his finger and thumb --he slaps
            his hands together on "Blammo".  

                                MALE LIBERTY MERCHANT (CONT'D)
                          (even more so)
                      How's that for justice?  How's that for
                      the big cosmic kiss off of the
                      millennium?  Huh?
                          (a beat)
                      -and if you think this is Kusari's
                      problem alone -- HA!  You've got another
                      thing coming.  We've ALL got another
                      thing coming.

                      National mourning continues for Lord
                      Quigley as does the all out manhunt for
                      those responsible for his murder.  Rumors
                      abound in our halls of terrorist
                      agitation, not from the Order, but from
                      the Seat of Power in Rheinland, itself. 
                      These allegations are as of yet,
                      unfounded and absolutely no evidence has
                      surfaced to support this. 
                      But today, the question on all Bretonian
                      subjects' lips is "Why?"

            After Juni calls on the Comm. and brings Trent to the
            Cambridge Pub, she may be onto something. 

            A2RTC7A - CAMBRIDGE PUB

            The Cambridge Pub is alive with activity.  Trent looks for
            Juni, but doesn't see her. He wades through the group - a
            more professional and cultivated mass than elsewhere - it's
            like yuppies on parade - with some academicians thrown in for
            good measure.  Still the music throbs on, lights flash - a
            few dance.  

            ANGLE ON: TRENT"S POV - tunnel vision through the crowd.  His
            head turns, scanning the mob.  Focusing on a clearing at the
            end - maybe some table off the beaten path. 

            REVERSE: Him pushing through.  Juni appears behind him in his
            wake as Trent still moves ahead.  She smiles to herself as if
            she's been watching him the whole time and takes satisfaction
            that he doesn't know she's there yet.  

                                JUNI
                      Not very perceptive, Trent.  If I were an
                      Order ship, you'd be dead.

            Trent stops.  He's surprised for a split second - but
            squelches this.  He smiles and turns.

                                TRENT
                      If you were an Order ship you wouldn't
                      have gotten this close.

            She saunters up to him, like a cat.  Searching his face.

                                JUNI
                      Is that so?

             A moment.  Trent's being challenged.  He stands his ground.

                                JUNI (CONT'D)
                      I hope you're right.

                                TRENT
                      Did you bring me here to test my Jedi
                      mind powers or do you have something
                      useful to offer.

            Zing.

            Truce for now. She changes and takes him by the arm and
            walks.

                                JUNI
                      Believe it or not, Trent, with Quintaine
                      out of the picture, trying to find an ice
                      monkey to ID this rock hasn't been the
                      easiest thing to do...

                                TRENT
                      Are you telling me you're empty?

            Juni senses the volley back from Trent's court.  She must
            have surprised him back there after all.

                                JUNI
                      You wish...  I'm telling you I found the
                      next best thing: a weak link.

            Trent stops and looks at her.  He's not following.  She takes
            him by the arm again and starts walking.

                                JUNI (CONT'D)
                      Trust me, will you - -  
                          (a beat)
                      By the way what do you know about Ship
                      and Cargo Insurance?

            He furrows his brow as they walkout of frame.  What is this?

            A2RTC7B - CAMBRIDGE PUB

            At a table, Juni and Trent sit together and try to look
            respectable - plainly uncomfortable to us -  as Vance, (the
            pilot from the teaser) sits facing them.  He looks like he's
            been stuck on Cambridge for a while.  As Vance talks, Trent
            shifts in his seat and Juni puts on her best game face on:
            She's been working this mark for a while.

                                VANCE
                      As I was saying - I was only hired to
                      carry the cargo from Pygar to Cambridge. 
                      Nobody said anything about a COD deal.

            Vance looks at him,then to Juni - questioning.

                                JUNI
                          (to Trent)
                      As I explained to Mr. Vance here... 
                          (she flashes Vance a winning
                           smile - and back)
                      That though his mission was classified

                      circumstances - ever disclose the details
                      therein...that as adjustors for Colonial
                      Insurance Limited, the company that
                      services government loss, we're keenly
                      interested in his claim.

            Trent tries to take this in.  He looks closer at Juni, who
            ever-so-gently nods towards Vance.  Trent shifts his
            attention to Vance who is sits expectantly. Nope.  Luckily,
            Vance has a bug up his ass.

                      A claim I filed over six months ago. I'm
                      in hock up to my neck after fixing my
                      ship.  I need that money.

                                JUNI
                          (to Vance)
                      Of course you do.
                          (to Trent)
                      I told Mr. Vance that we had a few
                      questions that might speed things
                      along...

            She...

                                JUNI (CONT'D)
                      About the ships...

            primes...

                                JUNI (CONT'D)
                      The "unidentified ships"...

            the ...

                                JUNI (CONT'D)
                      ..that attacked him and relieved him of
                      his cargo...

                                JUNI (CONT'D)
                      Cargo earmarked for Doctor Quintaine of
                      the Cambridge Xenology Institute.

            She emphasizes these last words, while still sounding
            plausible.  Vance barely starts to notice "something odd"
            when the light finally comes in Trent's dark house of a head.

                                TRENT
                          (testing the water)
                      Ah, yes.  We're interested.  Very
                      interested.
                          (a beat - more official
                           sounding)
                      Mr. Vance, Pygar is very far out isn't
                      it?

            Vance nods.  Of course.  Juni wonders where he's going.

                                TRENT (CONT'D)
                      So when you say "unidentified" ships
                      attacked you, do you also mean "alien"?

            Vance jumps at this.  Juni rolls here eyes - oh, shit.

                                VANCE
                      No.

                                TRENT
                      Because there have been these reports -

                      NO.

                           quote sign)
                      These "Nomad" reports that have - OW!

            A VIOLENT KICK under the table from Juni silences Trent.
            SOUND of everything jumping on the table.  When Vance looks
            again, they are both smiling - looking composed.  Vance gulps
            down his drink to cool himself off. 

                                JUNI
                      I'm sure what my colleague means is --

            Vance cuts her off and leans towards Trent.

                      this business.  I have a lot of
                      Government contracts to prove it.  If I
                      came back with a crazy story like that,

                      Dr. Quintaine would certainly never trust
                      me again.  It's bad enough his precious
                      find was jacked by those Pirates -
                      whoever they were... WHO, Mr. Trent.
                      Human Beings.  Get me?  You put that down
                      in your report.  

            He drives his point home with Trent, who nods.  Touchy, isn't
            he.

                                JUNI
                      About Dr. Quintaine.  We need a

            This is it.  Vance shakes his head.  DOUGH!

                      No, he left on business right after I got
                      back.  Don't know where.

            Trent gives Juni the "weak link, indeed" look.

                      Dr. Quintaine's colleague.  You know. 
                      It's in my claim.

            Trent nods.

                                TRENT
                      Right.

                      her.

                      And where could we find Dr. Sinclair

                      Oh, I took her out yesterday to another
                      of their damn fool dig sites -- Sprague,
                      in Omega 9.

            Their business is clearly done.  Trent and Juni get up and
            back out.

                                TRENT
                      Well thank you, Mr. Vance.  You've been
                      very helpful.  We'll process this and
                      you'll hear back from us soon.

            Vance is in mid drink, when they get up so abruptly.  They
            turn to go.  Vance shakes his head; he doesn't think much of
            Trent.

            A2RTC8A - EXT. SPRAGUE PLANETOID LANDING PAD - DAWN 

            Trent and Juni land, the deck is littered with equipment and
            cargo containers.  They get out and look around their
            surroundings, slowly walking.  Tunnels, dug into the very
            living rock wind off.

                          (surprised)
                      What was that for?

                                JUNI
                      Using a big word, Trent.  Maybe later
                      I'll teach you to use cutlery.

            The unfamiliar nature of the room keeps this from registering
            with Trent.  They stop at a cargo door.  She presses a
            button.  It opens.  Yawning darkness.  She looks to Trent.

                                TRENT
                      Oh, after you.

            She falters.  Shit, she was hoping he'd go.  He can read it
            on her.

            They go in and the door shuts behind them.

                                                                 CUT TO:

            A sudden shudder, low rumble with a staccato accent - like an
            enormous rusted door creaking open - very far down a tunnel -

            A dragging sound. Crunching.  Not footsteps, more like

            Closer.  A MUCH LOUDER SOUND (LIKE BEFORE) A HUGE RUMBLE AND
            SHUDDER.  They both scream.

            Click - A LIGHT PIERCES the darkness.  It flares on the lens
            and adjusts.  A woman, with a small flashlight, and a huge
            piece of equipment on a MAGLEV, so heavy it drags, stands and
            moves the light - investigating.  It's Dr. Sinclair.  

            She sees what we do not, Juni and Trent.

                                SINCLAIR

            REVERSE SHOT: Trent and Juni, now illuminated in a disk of
            brilliant light, that falls off at the edges.  They are in
            front of a rock wall -- and are also in each others arms.

            They suddenly realize that they are alright  - and attached. 
            They jump apart.  Their eyes are locked on the glare.

            Juni and Trent sit on the steps of the impressive dig site,
            while a few other devoted assistants work behind them. 
            SEVERAL LARGE PANELS WITH PARCHMENT ENCASED WITHIN lean
            against the site.

                      A salvager on Freeport station picked it

                                SINCLAIR
                      Look around you.  You see these panels?

            They do.

                                SINCLAIR (CONT'D)
                      These are the writings of the Daam
                      K'Vosh, a people that predate early man
                      by 1 million years and up until recently
                      the inhabitants of much of our new home. 
                      I've been working on piecing together
                      fragments of their culture, technology,
                      language ..anything.  It's my life's
                      work, do you see? 
                          ( a beat - to Juni)
                      No, I don't know what it is, but I know
                      it's critical to my work.  Think you'd
                      forget the find of your life?

            Dawning on Juni.  She's seen it before.

                                JUNI
                      This is the Artifact you found on Pygar.

                                TRENT
                          (surprised)
                      What?!

                                SINCLAIR
                      Yes. You are returning it, aren't you? 
                      Isn't that why you're here?

                                TRENT
                          (hesitantly)
                      Dr. Sinclair...It's not that simple.

                                SINCLAIR
                      Look, if it's a reward you're after, I -

                                TRENT
                      No.  

            Sinclair is puzzled.  Slow realization that these two are not
            just good samaritans...

                                SINCLAIR
                          (flatly)
                      Then why are you here?

                                JUNI
                      We came here to find Quintaine.  

                                SINCLAIR
                      Quintaine?  Ha!  I've needed his help in
                      translating these panels for six months. 
                      -Try the Ivory Towers of Cambridge.

                                JUNI
                      We did.  Your pilot, Vance, said he
                      hadn't seen him.  But he did oblige us by
                      giving us your name.

                                SINCLAIR
                          (rueful)
                      How special I am.  How many drinks did it
                      take?

                                TRENT
                          (quickly)
                      Nine.

            She looks at him and raises her eyebrows.  Impressive.

                                SINCLAIR
                      Well, as you can see he's not here and I
                      haven't spoken to him in months. So if
                      that's all -

            Trent suddenly jumps up.

                                TRENT
                          (to Sinclair)
                      Wait!  You don't know where he is?
                          (to Juni)
                      She doesn't know where he is.

            Juni shoots him a glance and then approaches Sinclair.

                                JUNI
                          (sotto - re: the artifact)
                      Doctor.  The man who found this is dead,
                      the station he was on was destroyed,
                      people, possibly including your colleague
                      Quintaine, have disappeared -- and now
                      we're being hunted --all because of this
                      Artifact.

            Sinclair looks at Trent.  He shrugs.

                                TRENT
                          (sheepishly)
                      They think we're smugglers.

                                SINCLAIR
                      I'm not surprised.

            Then back to Juni.

                                JUNI
                          (undaunted)
                      I want to know why.

            She looks at them both.  They anticipate.

                                SINCLAIR
                      Get out.

            Trent takes a step forward.

                                TRENT
                      Now wait a second.

            CLICK, CLICK, CLACK, CLICK, CLACK is heard.  Camera reveals
            that every assistant in the place has a HUGE WEAPON trained
            on them.  They are feet away - no chance.

            Her back to them now.

                                SINCLAIR
                      As you can see, we can take care of
                      ourselves.
                          (to the assistants)
                      Please escort them to their ships and
                      make sure they lift off.  Lock up the
                      panels for safe keeping.

                                JUNI
                      You're making a big mistake.  They'll be
                      coming here next.  They'll be coming for
                      you!

            She shouts the last words as they are hustled out.

            Sinclair handles the Artifact.  Holds it up to the light. 
            She feels a presence.

                                SINCLAIR
                          (to someone behind her)
                      You said others might come.  You were
                      right.

            Camera whips to Norrington.

                                NORRINGTON
                      The Order has long ears.  

            A2RTC8D - EXT. SPRAGUE PLANETOID - SPACE - AT THAT MOMENT

            A large Rheinland ship appears HIGH ABOVE and launches a
            bunch of fighters that head for the surface.

            A2RTC8E - EXT. SPRAGUE PLANETOID - LANDING DECK - DAY 

            Trent and Juni are escorted and pushed along to their ships. 
            The sun is hot.

                                JUNI
                      Nice work back there.  Very professional.

                                TRENT
                      Shaddup.

            As they walk, Trent glances over and sees the panels on a
            maglev - hovering a few feet above the ground and being
            pushed along by an assistant to a waiting cargo container on
            the deck.  There are other open containers, too, with
            everything from food to anti-ship weapons staged for
            transport.

            As they get to the ship, Trent sees a large wrench on the
            repair cart.  He has a cunning plan.

                                ASSISTANT #1
                      Go on.  Get in.

            He shoves Juni.  At that moment Trent grabs the wrench and
            holds it high above his head and screams.

                                TRENT
                      AAARRRGGGHHHHH!

            They all look at him in amazement, drop their jaws and lower
            their weapons.  He stands a frozen figure of Cro-Magnon
            poise. They run off.  Juni looks at them and then him --she
            was sure he'd get shot.  He smiles in a self-satisfied kind
            of way for a moment.  She then looks behind him, she reacts,
            taps him on the shoulder.

                                JUNI
                      Trent?

            He looks - TERROR.  Legs turn to jelly.

            ANGLE ON:  A WAVE of Rheinland Ships coming out of the sun
            and baring down on them.

            They run.

            The Rheinland ships open fire on the deck, creating huge
            havoc.  Some of the assistants fire back with their weapons
            and short work is made of them.

            Flame licks a munitions and fuel store.  VOOM!  It goes up. 
            More assistants go with it.

            A ship bears down on Trent and Juni.  He motions for her to
            hand her something O.S.  

            ANGLE ON: The ship zeroing in, firing.

            ANGLE ON: The ENORMOUS anti-ship weapon Trent brings to his
            eye.   The blasts hit around him.  This is a turning point
            for him - he's not going to take it anymore.  He squeezes the
            trigger.  VOOOM! Twin missiles hit the ship and it plummets
            into the side of a nearby mountain.

            Juni looks at him in amazement.  Pretty cool.

                                TRENT
                      Yes!

            A hand comes down on Trent's shoulder.  He spins.  It's
            Norrington with Sinclair in tow.

                                NORRINGTON
                          (re: Sinclair)
                      Mr. Trent, get her out of here.

                                SINCLAIR
                      I'm not going anywhere.

                                TRENT
                          (to Norrington)
                      Do I know you?

                                NORRINGTON
                      No, but I know you.
                          (to Sinclair)
                      The plans have changed.  And I've got my
                      orders. 

            A small spray hypo lulls her to sleep.

            More fighters.

                                NORRINGTON (CONT'D)
                       Sorry.
                          (to them)
                       Go now!

            Trent grabs the overturned maglev with the panels on it and
            puts Sinclair on it.

                                TRENT
                      Come on!

            Trent and Juni run until the maglev goes faster then they can
            run.  They jump on board.

            More explosions.  Flame!  A trellis collapses.  If they'd
            just run, they'd be dead.

            ANGLE ON:  POV Maglev -VERY LOW - VERY FAST - across the
            deck, up to the ships. Trent's feet hit the deck and they
            slow down the makeshift skiff.  They look.  Both ships look
            good.

                                JUNI
                      You take Sleeping Beauty - I'll see you
                      up.

            Trent nods.  She makes for her ship and Trent hits his (with
            the Maglev and Sinclair)

            They take off.

            MISSION 10 (PART 2)

            See Mission Pack.

            A2RTC9 - INT. OMEGA-9 RESEARCH STATION OUTPOST - LANDING DECK

            The ships penetrate the still-active force shield that
            encases the yawning mouth of the deck.  

            Trent lands first and looks around.  He approaches the end of
            the deck as Juni's ship lands. He looks out into space. 
            Outside, the asteroids and Nebula gasses swirl.  It's
            beautiful and humbling in a way.  Juni stands next to him.

                                JUNI
                          (re: Sinclair)
                      How is she?

                                TRENT
                      Still snoozing.

                                JUNI
                      You know, Trent.  When I met you I
                      thought you were --charming.

            He looks at her - she rephrases.

                                JUNI (CONT'D)
                      In a little lost puppy kind of way. 
                      Sad...helpless. Pathetic.  Homely.

                                TRENT
                      I get it.

            He shifts his weight and goes back to looking outside.

                                JUNI
                      But what you did back there...
                          (a beat)
                      Was incredibly stupid.  What were you
                      thinking?

            He shrugs.

                                TRENT
                      Nothing.  I just reacted.

                                JUNI
                          (genuine)
                      It was brave, Trent, very brave.

            They look at each other now.  A lonely alarm sounds once. It
            surprises them.

                                COMPUTER VOICE
                          (echoing)
                      Perimeter alert.

                                TRENT
                      Great.  Probably more Rheinland ships.

            Trent gets an idea.

                                TRENT (CONT'D)
                      C'mon.

            She stops him.

                                JUNI
                      Where are we going?

                                TRENT
                      Dunno.  Either the shop or the Pub.

            He exits frame.  Camera stays with Juni who looks after him.

                                JUNI
                          (calling after him)
                      Where?

                                TRENT
                          (calling back)
                      Cambridge.  Let's go.

            She exits frame.

            Note: Various encounters happen on the way to...

            A2RTC10A - INT. LEEDS EQUIPMENT ROOM - NIGHT (PLAYS)

            Tobias is heading out the door.  It's well past midnight. 
            When he is met by Trent, Juni and a Maglev with a sheet over
            it.  At first he is startled, until Trent shushes him.

                                TOBIAS
                      Uh! Trent-boy.  Where have you been? 
                      I've been worried about you.

                                TRENT
                      Me, too.

            Tobias looks over and sees Juni.

            ANGLE ON: Tobias' POV as he starts at Juni's spiked boots -
            one foot tapping, up her thighs, waist, her crossed arms and
            then to her face.

            He stokes his beard.

                                TOBIAS
                          (re: Juni)
                      But I see you've been in good company.

                                TRENT
                          (embarrassed)
                      Juni, meet Tobias.

                                TOBIAS
                          (theatrically)
                      Richard Winston Tobias, Esquire.

            He kisses her hand.

                                TOBIAS (CONT'D)
                      Dear lady.

            She's taken aback by his antics, but it is flattering - sort
            of.

                                TRENT
                          (aside - hesitatingly)
                      Tobias ---sort of -- raised me.

                                JUNI
                      And from such humble beginnings ...you're
                      head grew to it's present size?  Hmmm. 

            Tobias sees the Maglev.

                                TOBIAS
                      And what do we have here?

            He pulls back the sheet a bit to reveal - to his shock - the
            head and shoulders of a girl - Sinclair.  Eyes shut, on a set
            of panels.

                                TOBIAS (CONT'D)
                      Another girl.  

            He looks up at Trent, squinting.

                                TOBIAS (CONT'D)
                          (sotto)
                      Tell me, boy, what have you been doing?

            A thought occurs to him.

                                TOBIAS (CONT'D)
                      Oh, tell me..she's not...

                                TRENT
                      No, she's not dead.

                                JUNI
                      Though she is a scientist and therefore
                      is dead from the neck down.

            Juni makes a face.  Trent shoots her a glance.

                                TRENT
                          (to Tobias)
                      She's just sleeping.
                          (a beat)
                      Listen, Tobias, we need a place to stay.

                                TOBIAS
                      Easy: Dead storage.  

            Tobias and Trent - Maglev and all leave a puzzled Juni.

            Close ON HER.

                                JUNI
                      Dead storage?  Trent, we're staying in a
                      place called dead storage?

                                                                WIPE TO:

            A2RTC10B - INT. LEEDS EQUIPMENT ROOM - ANTE ROOM/STORAGE 
            LATER

            The panels are off the Maglev and Juni and Tobias are looking
            after Sinclair.  Trent enters.  Juni is looking over the
            Artifact.

                                TRENT
                      She's still out?

                                JUNI
                      Cold.  Whatever that guy used on her
                      meant business. 

            She gets up and takes him aside.

                                JUNI (CONT'D)
                      Listen, we need to get back in business. 
                      We've got Sinclair and her work, that'll
                      do for a start, but if we're going to get
                      to the bottom of this we still need
                      Quintaine - he sounds like the real
                      master here.  We're also going to need
                      cash.

                                TRENT
                      Fine, I'll go ---maybe I can take a scan
                      of Quintaine with me.  You'll both be
                      safe here with Tobias.

            As he says this, Sinclair begins to wake up.

            HER POV:  Murky, swimmy, up from the darkness and focusing
            right on the smiling face of Tobias.

            She does what any well educated woman might do.  Screams. 
            Tobias looks unsure.  Juni goes back to her.

                                TRENT (CONT'D)
                          (to himself)
                      I hope.

            He leaves.

                      A near-tragedy was averted today in New
                      Geneva as security forces swarmed the
                      Summit meeting and wrestled a gunman to
                      the ground before he could fire off a
                      shot.  He was taken into custody and his
                      identity has yet to be released, though
                      the incident did spark rumors of the
                      Order's involvement. His intended target,
                      if he had one, is not known at this time.

            A2RTC11RUMOR5 - INT. CAMBRIDGE PUB

            A SHADY GUY is having a drink.

            ANGLE ON: A BOTTLE being set down in frame.  Trent sits.

                                SHADY GUY
                      'Ere, who told you - you could stay?

            Trent pours two drinks and sets one in front if him.

            The Shady Guy hesitates at first, but once he sees Trent
            drink.  He caves a bit.

                                SHADY GUY (CONT'D)
                      Well, maybe just one.

            Another drink slams down in front of him.  He looks at it and
            to Trent.

            Quick cuts:

            Another.

            Another.

            He drinks.

            Trent drinks.

            Another.

            Slam.

            Slam.

            ANGLE ON: A Scanpic of Quintaine.  It gently sways. 

            Reverse on: The Shady Guy also gently swaying.  Trent is
            fine.  Rock steady as he holds the scanpic.

                                SHADY GUY (CONT'D)
                          (blearily)
                      Yeah, I seen him.

            He looks at Trent.  Trying to focus.

                                SHADY GUY (CONT'D)
                          (slowly)
                      Been a while, tho.   Heard he went
                      underground.  Looking for something.  Or
                      was that something looking for him.  I
                      dunno.  

                                TRENT
                      I just want to know if he's alive.

                                SHADY GUY
                          (slurring)
                      'Spect so.  He looks smart.

            His face is buried in the scanpic.

                                SHADY GUY (CONT'D)
                          (slurring)
                      'Sides, a guy like that bites it - a guy
                      on the run, I mean, I'da heard.

            That's all he wanted to know.  Trent takes the last drink and
            slams the empty glass down.  He nods his thanks.  

            LOW SHOT: Trent gets up and SLO-MO walks through the crowd -
            with purpose.  Music plays - lotsa' guitar.  Trent leaves
            frame.  In the bg, the Shady Guy falls over in a drunken
            heap.

                      Still hope for peace?  Today, the Peace
                      Summit in New Geneva came to an abrupt
                      end as the Rheinland representative,
                      having become increasingly more hostile
                      with Kusari, suddenly left the
                      proceedings amid surprised onlookers. 
                      Despite repeated attempts to get him to
                      rejoin the group - he left proclaiming
                      that the Rheinland borders would be
                      closed to all Kusari citizens.  
                      In related news - We have just received
                      reports that many Kusari citizens, still
                      in Rheinland, have been placed under
                      arrest "for their own safety".  The
                      Kusari are outraged at this unprovoked
                      behavior and have expelled the Rheinland
                      diplomatic staff.  In a statement from
                      Manhattan, President Jacobi implored
                      Rheinland negotiators to return to the
                      Peace Summit - which remains in recess at
                      this time - but also cautioned that she
                      would not tolerate the detention of
                      innocent citizens from a sister colony
                      and demanded their release.

            Trent happens on a BRETONIA ELITE GUARD.

                                BRETONIA ELITE GUARD
                      Hey, friend, I've just been pulling duty
                      in Omega-13.  If you're thinking about
                      heading out that way, don't.  Rheinland's
                      fortified their outposts and mined some
                      of the zones.  Then there are the ships.

                                TRENT
                          (suddenly interested)
                      Ships?  What ships?

                                BRETONIA ELITE GUARD
                      Rheinland, I guess.  'Cept they were
                      different.  They could cloak,  Which is
                      exactly what they did when we tried to
                      get a better look.  If they're gearing up
                      for war, the first thing they'd do is use
                      their new tech they've been keeping under
                      wraps.  And what better place than in the

            Trent finds a BRETONIA MERCHANT in a booth.

            CLOSE SHOT:  Backlit hands gesturing with a lighter and a
            cigarette.  

                                BRETONIA MERCHANT (O.S.)
                      I still can't believe it.  But it looks
                      like we're headed for war in the
                      colonies.

            The hands light the cigarette and a mouth inhales deeply -
            holds it -  then exhales.

            Camera barely widens to include the face in ECU of the
            corpulent merchant.  Sweat beads on him as if he were made of
            cheese and it was summertime.  Smoke continues to pour from
            his nose and mouth as he speaks.  His lighter goes out of
            frame and is replaced with a cocktail sword with three olives
            on it.

                                BRETONIA MERCHANT (CONT'D)
                      These Rheinlanders have some bollocks
                      though.  Locking up those Kusari
                      merchants and the like.  They're gonna
                      single-handedly grind the market to a
                      halt.

            He pops the olives and chews - followed by a long drag again.  

                                BRETONIA MERCHANT (CONT'D)
                      You mark my words.

            He keeps chewing with his big open mouth, mixing the two
            flavors.

                      Reports are flooding in that the first
                      strains of bitter conflict sounded in
                      Epsilon-Chi, as a Kusari Transport Convoy
                      was fired upon by a Rheinland attack
                      wing.  Rheinland claimed that they had
                      proof that this was a rogue Kusari
                      convoy, transporting weapons of mass
                      destruction into the system.  They
                      indicate that they fired warning shots
                      but were forced to destroy the convoy. 
                      The Kusari reacted with anger, stating
                      that the convoy was only carrying food
                      and medical supplies - and insisted on
                      seeing proof to the contrary.  Rheinland
                      has yet to respond.

            Trent approaches a few people asking the same question, with
            the scanpic of Quintaine:

                      Have you seen this man?

            He probably says it a few times, like 5.  So, not only should
            the reads emphasize different words, as in -

                                TRENT (CONT'D)
                      Have you seen this man?

            but also:

                                TRENT (CONT'D)
                      How 'bout you?

                                TRENT (CONT'D)
                      What about you?

                                TRENT (CONT'D)
                      You seen this guy?

            Etc. 

            He will receive blow-offs (see Game Script - GMO's) until he
            hits the right guy.  This right guy:

            Trent walks up to the ROUGH BRETONIAN HENCHMAN, whose head is
            low over his drink.

                                TRENT
                      I'm looking for someone, have you seen -

            The Rough Bretonian Henchman looks up - Trent stops cold.  He
            has a very crappy robotic eye of several inches that
            continues to telescope, whine and whirr as his focus changes. 
            It also seems to look around independently like a titanium
            snail eye, really drawing attention to itself on an
            otherwise, merely unshaven and shabby individual.  Trent
            notices this but tries not to grimace.  Trent swallows.

                                TRENT (CONT'D)

            The Henchman cocks his head and his eye.  Click.  Click.

                                ROUGH BRETONIAN HENCHMAN
                      Maybe, I seen 'im.

            The word seen makes Trent wince.  The Henchman looks
            carefully.  Whirrr...click..clock...Whiiirrrr.  After a
            moment.  

                                ROUGH BRETONIAN HENCHMAN (CONT'D)
                      Hmmmm.....Yeah.

            His eye looks behind his head, then WHIP! - back at Trent.
            (Who jumps ever so slightly).  The Henchman points over his
            own shoulder with his thumb.

                                ROUGH BRETONIAN HENCHMAN (CONT'D)
                      'Ere, ask that bloke in the corner.  I
                      seen them together the other day.

            He goes back to his drink.  PING!  The sound of a couple of
            credits that pop into the Henchman's Neuronet.

                                TRENT
                      Thanks.

            Trent looks over to where the Henchman pointed.

            A2RTC15 - INT. HIDDEN DECOMMISSIONED DREADNAUGHT - THE GROTTO

            CLOSE SHOT of shifty eyes peeking over cards.  Smoke.  The
            cards come down revealing ACE DEXTER HOVIS, sitting with his
            back to the room, playing cards with a group of Cronies. 
            He puffs a stub of a cigar and looks and sounds much older
            than his forties Bretonian frame might suggest.

                                TRENT
                      Guy over there said that you were with
                      this man?

            Trent holds out the scanpic of Quintaine.

                                DEXTER
                          (without looking)
                      Did he that, now?

                                DEXTER (CONT'D)
                      And what care you about my acquaintances?

            Trent is still talking to his back.

                                TRENT
                      I've got a message for him.  It's
                      important.  I was sent to find him.

                                DEXTER
                      Sent, were you?

            He slowly turns around and looks at Trent, then back again.

                                DEXTER (CONT'D)
                      Well, I'm sending you back.

            Laughter from the table.

                                TRENT
                      I don't think so.

            The laughter turns to "oooooohs".

                                TRENT (CONT'D)
                      If you are who I think you are, you'll
                      tell me where I can find Dr. Quintaine
                      and deliver my message. 

                                DEXTER
                      And if I'm not?

                                TRENT
                      Then I'll play you for the info I want.

            Dexter grunts, it was a crappy hand anyway.  The table
            clears.  Trent sidles past the roughnecks and sits across the
            table from Dexter.

                                DEXTER
                      So a bettin' man, you are?

            Trent nods.

                                DEXTER (CONT'D)
                      High stakes?

                                TRENT
                      The highest.

            Dexter likes this.

                                DEXTER
                      Well, bettin' man, then cards is not our
                      game. 

                                TRENT
                      What then?

                                DEXTER
                          (like a snake)
                      A race.

            Thrown.

                                TRENT
                      A race?

            Dexter smiles and nods - his row of platinum teeth, filed to
            a point, shimmer.

                                DEXTER
                      Outside.

            Dexter puffs and gets up, so does the mob.  There is
            pandemonium.

            MISSION 11 (PART 2: THE RACE)

            See Mission Pack.

            Note: The rules and stakes are laid out to Trent in the
            cockpit.  Also, if he runs or loses - he dies.  If he wins,
            Dexter will deliver.

            MISSION 11 (PART 3: RESCUE QUINTAINE)

            See Mission Pack.

            Note: Rescue Quintaine from the Rheinland attackers.  Trent
            is then told to land on the Mining Ship, The Glorious.

            A2RTC16A - INT. THE GLORIOUS - LANDING DECK

            As Trent lands he is besieged upon by grubby Prate hands that
            pull him from his ship, disarm him and poke and prod him with
            many dangerous edged and energy weapons.  The din is
            deafening in the metal tin can of a ship as Pirates cheer and
            jeer.  He is driven to the floor at the feet of...

                                TRENT
                      Dr. Quintaine, I presume.

            He looks up and sees the man.  Early Fifties, balding but
            very fit - like Patrick Stewart - he is dressed in commando
            style gear - all black.  Not like the typical scientist. 

                                QUINTAINE
                      And who are you?

            Trent starts to get up and is slammed to the floor with the
            but of a pulse rifle.

                                TRENT
                      OW!

                                QUINTAINE
                      Let me ask you again - who are you?

                                TRENT
                      My name is Trent.  Dr. Sinclair sent me
                      to find you.

                                QUINTAINE
                      I find that hard to believe, since she
                      has no idea where I am.  
                          (firmer)
                      Now - who sent you?

                                TRENT
                      I told you - Dr. Sinclair.  I found her
                      on Sprague and then the Rheinlanders
                      attacked -

                                QUINTAINE
                      Enough!
                          (after a moment of thinking -
                           to the Pirates)
                      Push him out of the airlock.

            They cheer, grab him and start to carry him off over their
            heads.  All the while, Trent protests - 

                                TRENT
                      No!  Wait!  Please!!
                          (finally)
                      I have your artifact.

            Quintaine's hand shoots up --stop.  They all fall silent at
            once and Trent is put down.  Quintaine takes a few steps
            forward.

                                QUINTAINE
                          (quietly)
                      What did you say?

                                TRENT
                          (quickly - for his life)
                      I have your artifact, the one Sinclair
                      lost. I've found it.  That's why we need
                      you.

            This is unexpected.  Quintaine turns his back, thinking and
            rubbing his bald head gently.  This is very unexpected. 
            Finally, he turns.  He snaps his fingers --SNAP! A blade is
            put to Trent's throat.  A PIRATE GIRL appears, smiles and
            frisks him.  He looks down --he'd probably enjoy this if his
            neck wasn't bleeding from the razor sharp weapon.  She stands
            and shakes her head, no.

                                TRENT (CONT'D)
                      I don't have it on me.

            He get's slammed to the deck again.

                                TRENT (CONT'D)
                          (into the grate of the deck)
                      You know, I'm getting tired of this...

            Quintaine crouches down and is a few inches from Trent -
            perfectly safe.

                                QUINTAINE
                          (sotto)
                      So, where is it then?

            Camera is close on them both.

                                TRENT
                          (slowly)
                      Sinclair has it - back on Leeds - in
                      hiding....You won't find her without me.

            Quintaine studies his face.  Finally - he extends his hand. 
            Trent takes it, he stands and the others back off.

                                QUINTAINE
                      Very well, Mr. Trent, I'll come with you. 
                      But we won't go back alone.

                                                                WIPE TO:

            A2RTC16B - EXT. THE GLORIOUS 

            Trent's ship and two pirates take off as escort.

            MISSION 11 (PARTS 4 AND 5)

            See Mission Pack.

            A2RTC17 - EXT. LEEDS LANDING PAD - DUSK (PLAYS)

            After Trent lands, he and a cautious Quintaine step out of
            his ship onto the ramp.  Quintaine is dressed in a cloak over
            his black garb, hood down.  He looks around at the deck,
            bathed in the orange glow.

                                QUINTAINE
                          (resigned)
                      Into the mouth of the dragon...

                                TRENT
                      You should keep out of sight until we get
                      Sinclair.

                                QUINTAINE
                      Oh, don't worry, Mr. Trent, I intend to
                      stay right here --and watch your ship.

            A small smile.  He puts up the hood.  It shrouds his face in
            shadow.

                                QUINTAINE (CONT'D)
                      Signal me when you're ready.

            Trent nods and takes off down the ramp.

            A2RTC18RUMOR8 - INT. LEEDS PUB

            Trent walks up to the BRETONIAN PILOT, young, friendly in a
            workingman kinda way.

                                BRETONIAN PILOT
                          (sotto)
                      'Ear, 'ave you 'eard 'bout the Rheinland
                      ships bein' seen 'ear and there all over
                      the colonies?  I 'aven't seen 'em yet,

                          (a beat)
                      You watch yourself out there.  I don't
                      know what they're on about, but it can't
                      be good right now.

            VO over text: 

                                BRETONIAN NEWSCASTER (V.O.)
                      In breaking news, President Jacobi of
                      Liberty just issued a statement that
                      openly blasted the Rheinland Government
                      and the Kaiser for their actions.  She
                      also pointedly cautioned them that any
                      unauthorized Rheinland military vessels
                      that intruded in Liberty space would be
                      met with defensive force.  

            A2RTC19RUMOR9 - INT. LEEDS PUB

            Trent finds the LIBERTY MERCHANT, 40's, short haired and
            filling out a bit.  He hold a generous hi-ball.  Sound of ice
            slinking class.  Stirring occasionally.

                                LIBERTY MERCHANT
                      With the President bringing out the big
                      guns, Rheinland had better watch it's
                      ass.  She's not fooling around - You
                      know, you can only push Liberty so far
                      and them --wham - we drop the hammer. 
                      Everybody else had better get their act
                      together and fast.

            A2RTC20A - INT. LEEDS EQUIPMENT ROOM - NIGHT

            Trent and a cloaked Quintaine find Tobias just finishing a
            transaction.  He sees them on the far side of the room and
            escorts the other Pilot out the door.

                                TOBIAS
                      Wonderful doing business with you.  Thank
                      you.  Good night.

            CLOSE UP: Doors closing. PSST! CLANG!

            CLOSE UP: Tobias' fingers on the locking panel.  Buttons
            lights.

            ANGLE ON: Tobias turning to face the approaching Trent and
            Quintaine.  He looks Quintaine up and down.

                                TOBIAS (CONT'D)
                      Sweet Jesus, what are you supposed to be?

                                TRENT
                          (re: Quintaine)
                      Under cover.

                                TOBIAS
                      What? In that get up?
                          (laughs)

            Quintaine pulls down his hood, angrily.

                                QUINTAINE
                          (a little offended)
                      Listen, I'll have you know I blend in
                      perfectly.

            Tobias looks at him again - and stifles another laugh. He
            doesn't buy it.  Quintaine looks at Trent, who tries to look
            reassuring against Tobias' infectious laughter.

                                TRENT
                          (sotto - conspiratorially)
                      Tobias, he's a scientist.

            He laughs even louder.

                                TOBIAS
                          (jovially)
                      Oh, I can see that.
                          ( a beat)
                      Come on Mr. Wizard, I expect you've come
                      to see the Missus.

            Tobias turns them to go.  Quintaine, ruffled, yanks at his
            cloak.

                                                           SMASH CUT TO:

            A2RTC20B - INT. LEEDS EQUIPMENT ROOM - ANTE ROOM/STORAGE - A
            MOMENT LATER

            CLOSE ON: Sinclair looking up.

                                SINCLAIR
                      Quintaine!

            REVERSE: On them coming through the door.  It closes in bg as
            she runs up to him.  She hugs him.  

            Juni comes up to Trent.

                                JUNI
                          (critical)
                      So, what took you so long?  I've been
                      packed for days...

            He looks at her..she then breaks into a smile.  So does he. 
            She extends her hand.  He takes it.

                                JUNI (CONT'D)
                          (genuine)
                      It's good to see you, Trent.

                                TRENT
                      You, too.

            They start to walk to where the Doctors are.

                                TRENT (CONT'D)
                      How are things with the Doctor?

                                JUNI
                      Oh, I think I liked her better when she
                      was sleeping.

            As if coming to her senses, Sinclair pushes Quintaine back -
            pissed, as the others look on.

                                SINCLAIR
                          (angry)
                      Dammit.  I'm mad as hell at you.  What
                      happened to you?  Where have you been?

                                QUINTAINE
                      I had to go underground.  I made a
                      significant breakthrough with the Daam
                      K'Vosh glyphs; even deciphering some of
                      the fragments that you had already
                      catalogued.  Then news of your find
                      reached me...and others apparently.
                          ( a beat)
                      I was being followed, my comms were
                      tapped, my was home ransacked....Kendra,
                      someone planted a bomb in my lab -- 

                                SINCLAIR
                      Oh, my God ... Your research?

            He point to his head and smiles.

                                QUINTAINE
                      All up here.  But you see, I had to go, I
                      had to hide, I couldn't tell anyone -
                      especially you, because then you might
                      become a target.

                                JUNI
                          (interrupting)
                      She already is.  We all are.  Because of
                      this -

            She holds up the Artifact.

            ANGLE ON: The Artifact glowing in fg and Sinclair's
            expression of wonder.

            He walks up, still in awe.

                                QUINTAINE
                      May I?

            He takes it.

                                QUINTAINE (CONT'D)
                      I can hardly believe it.  

            He's almost giddy despite the dower circumstances. 

                                TRENT
                      I hate to rush this reunion along but -

            A SMALL ALARM SOUND BEEPS - and a RED LED glows on Tobias'
            wrist, cutting off Trent.  Tobias looks down at it and then
            at them.

                                TOBIAS
                      Perimeter alarm.  Someone's here.  I'll
                      take care of it.

                                                                 CUT TO:

            A2RTC20C - INT. LEEDS EQUIPMENT ROOM - SECONDS LATER

            Tobias walks from dead storage to the main door.  Unknown to
            him, Trent is hanging back and moves from the archway to the
            Bretonian Ship on the Repair Pad.

            As Tobias reaches the door, it opens, it's lock having been
            picked.  He almost breaks stride as he sees this, but then
            puts on his Dealer face as the MOB of RHEINLAND ELITE GUARDS
            forces it open and steps into the room.

                                TOBIAS
                          (clapping his hands together -
                           his line of BS masking his
                           concern)
                      Hello, my Friends.  I was coming to let
                      you in, but I see you found your own
                      way...So, what is it I can get for you
                      today?

            He walks right up to the RHEINLAND ELITE GUARD LEADER,
            looking hard and driven, cracks deep in his weathered, cruel
            face.

                                TOBIAS (CONT'D)
                          (still upbeat)
                      Rheinlanders, aren't you?  Perhaps an Ion
                      Drive or some armor.  Maybe some
                      education in foreign policy...

            Without a word, the Leader draws his side arm and shoots
            Tobias point blank.  Tobias coughs and turns, looking
            surprised.

            ANGLE ON: Tobias in the foreground, flanked by the Guards.

            ANGLE ON:  Quick Zoom to Trent's face in the cockpit of the
            fighter. 

                                TRENT
                          (muffled through the glass)
                      NO!!

            ANGLE ON: Quick push in on - their eyes lock for a moment. 
            Tobias reaches down and brings up his bloody hand.  He looks
            back up to Trent --there is so much to say..all he can do is
            smile weakly and almost shake his head - until -- 

            BLAM!  The Leader shoots him from behind.  Crushing the life
            from him.

                                RHEINLAND ELITE GUARD LEADER
                      They're here somewhere.  Kill them.

            They all nod.

            Suddenly the sound of a ship powering up fills the room. 
            This gets their attention and the Leader strains to see who
            is behind the glass. 

            ANGLE ON: Trent in the cockpit, fighting back tears.  Blind
            with anger.  Targeting control comes on line.  

                                COMPUTER VOICE
                      Targeting computer on-line.

            He reaches down as his sites set on the approaching Guards.

                                TRENT
                      Come on you fucking bastards.

            He hits the console - as if to make it work faster.

            They advance on him. Finally -

                                COMPUTER VOICE
                      Weapon systems on-line.

            He reaches for the control.

            ANGLE ON: The control.

                                TRENT
                      Say good night.

            He fires!

            Laser and projectile fire rip the deck and the soldiers
            apart.  Even those who manage to squeeze a few shots off are
            pulverized by the MASSIVE CALIBRE FIREFIGHT.  All gone. 
            Smoke fills the deck.

            ANGLE ON: The MINI-PULSE GUN CONTINUES TO SPIN --even though
            he is out of ammo.  Trent is keyed up --he finally releases
            fire control.  The Mini-Pulse Gun cuts off.  He gets up and
            runs for Tobias.

            ANGLE ON:  A surprised Juni, Quintaine and Sinclair emerge to
            the rubble and bodies.  Nobody says a word..there is nothing
            to say.  Juni sees Trent crouched over the now quite dead
            Tobias.

            Juni puts her hand on Trent's shoulder.  The SOUND of Guards
            approaching.

                                JUNI
                      Trent.  Come on.

            He doesn't move - he's locked on Tobias' face.  It's odd, he
            looks peaceful.

                                JUNI (CONT'D)
                          (more firmly)
                      Come on!

            Trent takes a last look and then bolts with them to the door.

            A2RTC20D - EXT. LEEDS LANDING PAD - NIGHT (PLAYS)

            They make a run for their ships, illuminated by spotlights. 
            Suddenly, Rheinland Guards fire on the surprised Bretonian
            Guards that are standing around.  Sinclair turns to look. 

                                JUNI
                      Keep going!

            Trent pushes her along.  The Rheinland Guards start to fire
            on Trent and the group.  Quintaine, Juni and Trent return
            fire - hitting a few.

                                TRENT
                          (to Juni - re: Sinclair and
                           them)
                      Take them.  I'll follow you.

                                JUNI
                      You'd better.

            A moment. He looks at her.

                                TRENT
                      I will.

            Juni piles in Quintaine and Sinclair, the door closes.  Trent
            goes to his own ship.  Despite Rheinland laser blasts on the
            hull, they both take off and head for space.

            ACT THREE

            Note: Juni and Trent have split up for the moment after
            Mission 12.  Before they do - Quintaine comms. and states
            that the research is incomplete; he is referring Trent to a
            colleague whom he will contact.  

            Leaving Trent to enjoy -

            A3RTC1RUMOR1 - ANY KUSARI BAR

            Trent brushes the dust off of his clothes as he walks up the
            hall to the bar.  He looks around - It already seems like a
            different world; armor-clad Kusari guards, exotic women and
            shrewd merchants tend to favor these kinds of places -
            besides the usual run of pilots and majordomos. 
            Still there's something about the atmosphere..as Trent walks
            up to the bar he feels, well...isolated.   

            He looks around for the KUSARI BARTENDER, who is down the bar
            speaking to another customer, A KUSARI MERCHANT.  They are
            deeply engaged.  

            ANGLE ON: Trent as he tries to focus in on the conversation,
            without calling attention to himself.

            CLOSER: On the two - speaking.

                                KUSARI BARTENDER
                      --- What are you saying, that Rheinland
                      has no intention of letting our people
                      go?!  But they're innocent.

                                KUSARI MERCHANT
                      I know.  A friend of mine escaped from
                      there - he said that they've all been
                      taken to some sort of research facility
                      in Tau-Sigma. 

                                KUSARI BARTENDER
                      I would damn the Kaiser to the Hell of
                      the Upsidedown Sinners if I could!  Why
                      hasn't your friend come forward with
                      this?

                                KUSARI MERCHANT
                      He has...He spoke to The Shogun himself.  

            The Bartender is impressed.

                                KUSARI MERCHANT (CONT'D)
                      But the Tau-Sigma prison appears to be
                      secret..it -

            He stops.  Trent looks up --they are both scowling at him. 
            The weight of their displeasure is crushing.  Trent tries to
            look like he wasn't eavesdropping.  The Merchant turns in his
            seat - his back to Trent and the Bartender leans in.  They
            continue their conversation in private - whispers.  Trent
            looks around.  Nice place.

                                KUSARI NEWSCASTER (V.O.)
                      Today, as part of Kusari's ongoing
                      interests in Peace - despite the criminal
                      actions of Rheinland, Governor Tekagi
                      arrived under armed escort in Manhattan,
                      the Liberty capitol. There he met with
                      President Jacobi and Queen Carina, of
                      Bretonia, in the hopes of agreeing on a
                      joint resolution to pressure the Kaiser
                      to return to the negotiating table and
                      quickly establish a peaceful resolution
                      to Rheinland's savage actions.

            A3RTC2RUMOR2 - ANY KUSARI BAR

            Trent encounters TISHIRO, he is younger than some, different,
            sitting at a table.  Surprisingly, he speaks to Trent -

                                TISHIRO
                      You'll have to forgive some of my
                      countrymen.  They don't take well to
                      strangers.  But we are a practical
                      people; If you're good you can always
                      find work.  However, it never hurts to
                      obey local customs. 

            He makes it a point to bow his head to Trent - and then wait.

            ANGLE ON: Trent.  He's sharp - he gets it.  He bows.

            Tishiro welcomes him and motions for him to sit.  He slide a
            drink over to him.  Trent takes it and nods his thanks.  They
            both drink -sharing a moment.  Hopefully this will ease
            Trent's transition to this society a bit.

                                TISHIRO (CONT'D)
                          (confiding)
                      The real pressure is on the Rheinlanders
                      who are still within our borders.  It's
                      no fault of their own what their Leaders
                      do - but there is an air of mistrust and
                      violence around them.  
                          ( a beat)
                      Still, I spoke to one of them recently,
                      he denied the rumor that they have
                      developed cloaking technology.
                          (musing)
                      He could be lying, of course...He also
                      may not know.  I wonder...If they do have
                      it, do you suppose they could have taken
                      that leap by themselves?

            Tishiro drinks.

            ANGLE ON: Trent mulling this over.  The question os clearly
            rhetorical.  He drinks.

            A3RTC3RUMOR3 - ANY KUSARI BAR

            A KUSARI PILOT looks Trent up and down.  Sniffs in his drink.

                                KUSARI PILOT
                      It's unfair that your people hold so much
                      of our fate.

                      What do you mean?  Are you all right?

                                KUSARI PILOT
                      Look at you, pretending not to know how
                      much Liberty has taken.  You take and
                      take and take...and that's why we need
                      you to help us stop the Kaiser.  You have
                      sapped our strength.
                          (a beat)
                      Get away from me. 

            He kicks the chair and Trent stands.  The commotion draws
            stares.  Trent thinks it better to step away, the Pilot is
            obviously drunk and didn't even know he was Bretonian.

                                KUSARI NEWSCASTER (V.O.)
                      In a surprising turn of events, Governor
                      Tekagi announced at the noble delegates
                      of peace in Liberty that he saw no choice
                      but to attempt to meet with the Kaiser
                      personally, adding that to do any less
                      would surely result in war.  He left
                      immediately to return to Kusari, but not
                      before endorsing a joint initiative that
                      supported a Colony-wide ban on Artifacts. 
                      A practice that was recently put into
                      motion in Liberty.  President Jacobi
                      stated that she was pleased with the
                      decision, adding that the Governor voted
                      his conscience and acted on behalf of the
                      Shogun in this matter.  She went on to
                      explain that the case before the
                      delegates was simply that the artifact
                      threat is a real one, stressing the need
                      for them to be studied by top minds. 
                      Temporarily removing them from the hands
                      of the ordinary citizenry to whom they
                      may pose a mortal threat is only the
                      first step - but a necessary one.  

            A3RTC4RUMOR4 - ANY KUSARI BAR

            Trent walks near another Kusari Merchant, GENZO, 40's - lean
            with a mustache, being whispered to by an KUSARI MERCHANT
            ASSISTANT (KMA).  He reacts!  It catches Trent's attention.

                                GENZO
                          (enraged)
                      What!

            He clears the table with his hand.  Sound of glass breaking
            and metal clanging to the floor.  KMA cowers on the table -
            head down - averting his eyes.  

                                GENZO (CONT'D)
                      How am I to do business if the government
                      takes away my Artifacts?!!  Tell me that,
                      eh?

            KMA dare not speak.

                                GENZO (CONT'D)
                      Huh?!! Tell me!!

            He kicks the KMA out of the chair and towers above him.  KMA
            stays on the ground - whimpering.  Until -

                                KMA
                          (meekly)
                      They say they're dangerous, my Lord.

                                GENZO
                      Dangerous?!

            CLOSER on Genzo. He kicks KMA - out of frame.

                                GENZO (CONT'D)
                      How do they know?  Have you ever heard of
                      dangerous art?  Eh?  Who's going to
                      reimburse me my losses.  Tell me that?!

            Trent exits in the bg as Genzo kicks the KMA again.  Ow.

            THE QUEST BEGINS...

            Note: Quintaine finally calls Trent and tells him about
            Hashiro. He goes to Chubu to meet him.

            A3RTC5 - INT. CHUBU - TIGER AND LION BAR

            Kusari's caste system has allowances for people in certain
            occupations; since Trent is looking for a Xenoarcheologist,
            this is the place for his class.  It isn't exactly low by
            colonial standards, but it lacks the finery of the upper
            class places.  Trent surveys the crowd and approaches the
            back table.  HASHIRO, 50's, pleasant looking, younger than
            his years - except for the crows feet at his temples.  He
            stands and extends his hand.

                                HASHIRO
                      Mr. Trent.  I recognize you from Doctor
                      Quintaine's communication.

            Trent sees his outstretched hand and chooses to bend forward -
            bowing to Hashiro.  Hashiro is delighted.  Looks at his own
            hand.

                                HASHIRO (CONT'D)
                      I appreciate your gesture Mr. Trent.  It
                      serves one well to put others at ease.
                          (a beat)
                      Please sit.

            They both sit down.  Hashiro motions for service.  A YOUNG
            GIRL, 18, brings a tray with drinks.  She does not look up as
            she places the three glasses down and the Sake.  She bows. 
            Hashiro continues to observe Trent - who is watching the girl
            with some interest.  Trent looks up.

                                TRENT
                      Three glasses?

            Hashiro nods and smiles.

                                HASHIRO
                      Dr. Quintaine said you were sharp.  I
                      have invited a friend to join us.  A
                      friend from Naval Intelligence.

            Hashiro pours the drinks.  The CAMERA arcs around slowly as
            he speaks.  Trent is puzzled.

                                HASHIRO (CONT'D)
                      As you may or may not know, Mr. Trent,
                      the Government has imposed a ban on the
                      artifact trade in Kusari space.  The
                      museums have had their exhibits carted
                      away and even the homes of many private
                      collectors have been searched and their
                      artifacts confiscated. 
                      I am told that it's all being sent to the
                      Kusari Military Headquarters in Kanto. 
                      This makes what you seek more difficult
                      to come by, I'm afraid.
                          (a beat)
                      It is for this reason that I have invited
                      Lord Akiro.  In the hopes that he might
                      be -- helpful.

            ANGLE ON: Trent taking a sip of Sake.

                                TRENT
                      I see.  My thanks.

            In the bg - behind Trent, TWO RHEINLAND PILOTS, approach. 
            The camera stays low - a single on Trent.  His back stays to
            them.

                                RHEINLAND PILOT #1 (O.S.)
                      Hey, Liberty.  This man here says you owe
                      him some cash.

            Hashiro looks up at them and then back down to Trent - who
            takes another sip.

                                TRENT
                          (still looking forward)
                      I'm Bretonian.  And he's mistaken,
                      friend.  

                                RHEINLAND PILOT #1 (O.S.)
                      I don't think so.  He says if you don't
                      pay, he's going to take it some other
                      way.  Your ship...your hide...you choose.

            Trent narrows his eyes and springs into action, spinning and
            throwing HOT SAKE into the eyes of one of them and punching
            the other one full in the face.  CRACK! He goes down.

            An official looking man, LORD AKIRO, 50, greying, fit from
            years of warrior training, balanced by recent years of
            leadership and diplomacy, walks in with Two Guards.  He takes
            in the scene.  One of the Guards makes a move, Akiro holds up
            his hand --he's going to watch.  Meanwhile, the eyes of the
            RP#1 have cleared.  He's pissed off.   He pulls a knife.

            He and Trent square off.  

            ANGLE ON: The two men, singles of each as they dance.  Hands
            moving to defend.  Jab/block - kick/block.

            Swish!  The knife barely misses Trent's face.

            He punches RP#1 in the face.  He spits out the tooth and
            grins.

            Stab! The knife barely misses Trent's eye.   

            Trent kicks the knife out of his hand, it thuds into the wall
            above two surprised patrons.  PT-TWAANNGGG!

            Trent does some body work on RP#1 and then finishes with an
            uppercut that lifts him off of his feet.  He hits the ground
            hard.

            Done. Trent turns to see the other Rheinland Pilot (RP#2),
            having recovered, has a gun trained on him. 

            ANGLE ON: Trent. That Uh-oh look.

            RP#2 takes aim.  Squeezes the trigger.  And suddenly glows a
            brilliant blue and is lifted off of the ground.  Electricity
            crackles in the air.

            Trent looks and sees that Hashiro is using a wicked looking
            STUNNER on RP#2, lighting him up with 20,000 volts.  It
            shoots a brilliant arc from Hashiro's weapon like a firehose -
            and about as easy to control.  Hashiro manages with skill and
            surprising strength.

            ANGLE ON:  The brilliant glare on Lord Akiro's face.  He's
            fascinated.

            ANGLE ON: Trent covering his eyes.

            Hashiro cuts the juice and RP#2 falls to the ground limp. 
            Lord Akiro motions for his men to take the RP's away.  The
            bar is back to normal.

            Trent walks over to Hashiro and nods.  Hashiro is sitting
            quietly again, smoking Stunner on the table.  He's such a
            little guy, how did he hide such an OVERPOWERING and EXOTIC
            WEAPON?  It looks funny, occupying a large portion of the
            table.

                                TRENT
                      Thanks for your help.

            Hashiro is cool.

                                HASHIRO
                      Your fight was fair.  He took advantage.

                                LORD AKIRO (O.S.)
                      My friend Hashiro-san has always fought
                      for the underdog.

            Lord Akiro approaches the table.  Hashiro rises and bows.

                                HASHIRO
                      Lord Akiro.

            Trent turns as he walks up.  Trent studies his face, deep
            lines despite his aristocracy.

                                TRENT
                          (re: Underdog)
                      That's the first time I've been called
                      that.  I'm Trent.

            He begins to bow, but is stopped by Akiro.  He puts out his
            hand ...and after shooting a glance at Hashiro, who nods,
            slowly takes Akiro's hand and shakes it firmly.  Clearly this
            is Akiro's first time dealing with this gesture.  It is not
            his best move. Trent humors the diplomat in him.  Akiro
            gestures for them to sit.  They do.

                                LORD AKIRO
                      It is a pleasure to meet you, Mr. Trent. 
                      Thank you for such an entertaining
                      display.  I'm glad my men were here and
                      not the local authorities - otherwise you
                      would be in detention and your quest at
                      an end before it has begun.

            Trent looks at Hashiro.

                                LORD AKIRO (CONT'D)
                      Yes, Mr. Trent I have seen Dr.
                      Quintaine's communique.
                          (a beat)
                      You will find Hashiro-san a most valuable
                      and thorough ally. 

                                TRENT
                      Yes, I believe I have already.

            Hashiro nods to them both.

                                LORD AKIRO
                      Then he's already told you that what you
                      want is going to be hard to achieve.  The
                      Artifacts are kept in a place that only
                      very high ranking personnel can access.

            Trent nods.

                                LORD AKIRO (CONT'D)
                      However...there is one way.

            This gets their attention.

                                LORD AKIRO (CONT'D)
                      Apart from out trouble with Rheinland,
                      we've been plagued by the Black Dragons.

                                TRENT
                      Who are the Black Dragons?

            Hashiro chimes in as Akiro quietly drinks some Sake.

                                HASHIRO
                      They're a political opposition group that
                      has been disrupting our operations in
                      Chubu and Hokkaido. 

            Akiro nods his agreement and thanks.

                                LORD AKIRO
                      Mr. Trent, they have also been
                      responsible for the assassination of
                      several Kusari officials, such as myself.
                          (a beat)
                      What I want you to do is infiltrate the
                      Black Dragons.

            Trent is concerned about the obvious cultural and physical
            differences.

                                TRENT
                      Er...Pardon me, Lord Akiro, but I'm
                      not..I mean to say...I'm..well..not
                      Kusari.

            Akiro looks at Hashiro.

                                HASHIRO
                          (to Lord Akiro)
                      He's not.

            Then back at Trent.

                                TRENT
                      I'm not.

            Surprised at them both.

                                LORD AKIRO
                      I know.
                          (a beat)
                      Mr. Trent, you will pose as a Bretonian 
                      agitator sent here by your Government. 
                      The Black Dragons are not biased, except
                      in skill; If you are good, they will take
                      you.  Will you do it?

            ANGLE ON: Trent - slow push in.

                                TRENT
                      Just tell me what you want me to do.

            Lord Akiro gets up.  They begin to rise - he motions for them
            to keep their seats. 

                                LORD AKIRO
                      Don't worry, Mr. Trent.  I will... 
                      with this ...

            He places a SMALL DEVICE on the table in front of them. 
            Hashiro and Trent look at it.  Trent looks back up.

                                LORD AKIRO (CONT'D)
                      It is a Holographic Communicator.  Keep
                      it with you at all times, so I can
                      contact you.  My men will also be putting
                      a homer in your ship to better track you
                      in space.  You will find that useful
                      should you run into trouble.

            He turns and goes, saying those last words as he walks away. 
            They resonate with Trent.

                                TRENT
                          (calling after him)
                      Trouble?  Wait - what trouble?
                          (to Hashiro)
                      What trouble?

            Hashiro reassures him.

                                HASHIRO
                      Do not worry, Mr. Trent, Lord Akiro has
                      you under his protection.  He is going
                      now to make a way for you to appear more
                      appealing to the Black Dragons.  It may
                      take some time.  You should make use of
                      it and familiarize yourself with the area
                      and...

            He pauses.

                                TRENT
                      What?

                                HASHIRO
                      Do what comes naturally to you, Mr.
                      Trent.  

            ANGLE ON: Trent.  What is that, exactly?

                                KUSARI NEWSCASTER (V.O.)
                      Leaders from around the Colonies breathed
                      a sigh of relief as the Kaiser of
                      Rheinland accepted the offer from
                      Governor Tekagi to meet.  The Governor's
                      office refused to comment except to
                      reaffirm the Governor's desire to reach a
                      settlement...A sentiment echoed so many
                      times by President Jacobi of Liberty,
                      Queen Carina of Bretonia and the Late
                      Lord Quigley also of Bretonia.  Concern
                      at home for the Governor's safety has
                      risen as he intends to venture into a
                      land that already boasts the illegal
                      detention of many of our citizens. 
                      President Jacobi of Liberty also stated
                      that though she has her reservations
                      about Rheinland's sincerity she hoped
                      that Governor Tekagi will bring our
                      countrymen home, adding that any gesture
                      against the Governor would be viewed as
                      aggression against Liberty.

            A3RTC6RUMOR5 - ANY KUSARI BAR

            Trent,at a nearby table, sees KUSARI PILOT #2. He is playing
            a game, not unlike "Go" with another Kusari Man.  They are
            talking about the News.  Trent eavesdrops - better than
            before.

                                KUSARI PILOT #2
                          (to his friend)
                      Yes, I understand, but even if it his
                      duty, Tekagi must weigh the risks.  How
                      does he know the Kaiser won't arrest him
                      once he sets foot on Bismarck.  That he
                      won't try to ransom him.  Hmm?

            He looks down - his opponent has been studying the board the
            entire time.  Kusari Pilot #2 simply moves one piece.

                                KUSARI PILOT #2 (CONT'D)
                      Ha! I win again! 

            The other man shakes his head, beaten again.

            MISSION 13 

            See Mission Pack.

            He is forced to land.  BIG MUSIC - Trent is going into the
            Lion's Den.  Suddenly there is a sound - high pitched.

            TRENT'S POV: A brilliant beam fills his field of vision,
            emitted from a place above the landing bay.  A kaleidoscope
            of color and sound.  Before he can react, he begins to lose
            consciousness.  His ship is on in a tractor beam and...

                                                           FADE TO BLACK

            A3RTC7 - INT. BLACK DRAGON OUTPOST - LIMBO (PLAYS)

            Still Black.  The SOUND of swaying, rope on a beam.  

                                                             FADE UP ON:

            Black as the Camera falls on a hard edge of cold light. 
            Nothing can be seen but light and dark --no room detail - for
            all we know we're in a void, except for this polar opposite
            of a light edge reflecting off of the dust in the atmosphere.
            Camera follows the edge down until -

            An ECU of a closed eye and part of face gently sways in. It's
            Trent. He drifts into the darkness slightly then back into
            the light.  The darkness bisects his face, then light and out
            of frame. 

            ANGLE ON: The source of sound, Trent suspended by his heels
            by a rope going who knows where.  Creak - Creak.

            Wider on Trent: We see his whole face, now Camera is staying
            with him in his sway.  But something's not right.  The Camera
            turns slowly 180 degrees to the left and we see Trent in his
            true situation, upside down.  The distant sound of moisture
            and an echo. His eyes begin to open.

            A disembodied voice fills the room -- highly filtered and
            distorted.  No discernible source.

                      Why are you here?

            Trent tries to clear his head --he is realizing that he is
            upside down, his hands bound behind his back and he has a
            thunderous headache.  He struggles.  He sways a bit more.

                                VOICE (CONT'D)

                      I don't know... where am I?

            He looks around...nothing.

                      Oh, that's nice...
                          (a beat - to the Voice)
                      Hey, how do you know my name?

                      Again.  Why are you here?

                                TRENT
                      If you're going to ask me the same
                      question over and over this is going to
                      take a real long time.

            His head hurts.

                          (filter)

                      time.

                                TRENT
                          (in some pain)
                      Fine.  I came to find the Black Dragons.

                      Why?

                          (filter)
                      WHY?!

            Still nothing.  Trent tries to master his pain.  His
            attention is drawn to the sound of a METAL CLANG followed by
            a single pair of heel boots.  He strains to see and get a
            sense of where it's coming from.  The steps are light --not
            heavy, graceful, unhurried.  They stop just short of the
            shaft of light.  Though we do not know it yet, this is HIRADA
            MAKIKO, a young Kusari woman - barely 20, a key instrument of
            the Black Dragons.

                                MAKIKO (O.S)
                      My sources tell me that you are
                      Bretonian, sent by your government to
                      stir up trouble in the Kusari system. 
                      Why? 

            Trent realizes the cat is out of the bag. 

                                TRENT
                          (haltingly)
                      My people are worried about the Shogun's
                      ability to deal with the Kaiser....  They
                      believe that a more effective leader is
                      needed to stop him.

                                MAKIKO
                          (smoothly)
                      Surely this is not your affair,
                      Bretonian.  These are matters better left
                      to...  

            ANGLE ON: Makiko leans into the light - her beautiful,
            angular face illuminated.  Her eyes are penetrating.

                                MAKIKO (CONT'D)
                      -the bonds of blood.

            A look of recognition flashes on Trent's face.

                                TRENT
                      Hirada Makiko...

            She seems pleased.

                                MAKIKO
                      You know who I am.  Your Master's have
                      instructed you well.  Then you must also
                      know why we fight.

                                TRENT
                      You work for the Minenori Family to bring
                      about the end of the Natzu regime -  

                                MAKIKO
                          (sharply)
                      To reinstate the true rulers, Mr. Trent.

            The blood is beginning to pool in Trent's head.

                                TRENT
                      We have the same mission.

                                MAKIKO
                      But not the same motive, I'm afraid.

            She backs out of the light.

                                MAKIKO (O.S.) (CONT'D)
                      Your mission ends here.  Enjoy your last
                      few minutes of life, Mr. Trent.  

            The sound of boots walking away.  Trent begins to struggle
            more.  He's Freaking out.

                                TRENT
                          (calling after her - agony
                           building)
                      I'm not alone. _There are informants in
                      the Kusari military.  I can get
                      information...about ops..key
                      personnel...officials.  That's why I'm
                      here.  -- MAKIKO!

            His head is about to burst.  The Sound of the heel boots
            stopping.  There is a long pause.

                                MAKIKO
                          (slowly)
                      So...Very well, Mr. Trent, you've earned
                      your life - for now.  You will be my
                      "guest" while I consult our Leader. 
                      And... you'd better be every bit as
                      useful as you say.
                          (a beat - then - to someone
                           else)
                      Cut him down!

            ANGLE ON: CLOSE UP - A large blade jetting out of the
            darkness and cutting the rope just above his heels.  WHACK! 
            Dust and rope threads accent Trent's release.  His feet fall
            out of frame.

            A3RTC8RUMOR6 - INT. BLACK DRAGON OUTPOST - BAR

            Trent wanders into the bar.  Finds a musty bottle and pulls
            cork out.  He sniffs it --strong.  He needs a drink, the
            stronger the better.  He hears a sound behind him. He turns
            to see A BLACK DRAGON PILOT, Kusari, late 20's, scar, sitting
            behind him. 

                                BLACK DRAGON PILOT
                      You should count yourself fortunate.  Not
                      many men have survived an encounter with
                      Crimson Drake.

                                TRENT
                      Crimson..? Ah, Makiko.

                                BLACK DRAGON PILOT
                      You should show more respect, she is the
                      most feared pilot in Kusari.  In the five
                      years she has graced the Black Dragons
                      she has killed over seven hundred. 

                                TRENT
                      So she was all of fifteen when she joined
                      you.  That is impressive.  And she's the
                      best you've got?

            He nods.

                                BLACK DRAGON PILOT
                      She kills whom she likes...you could be
                      gone - like that.

            He snaps his fingers.  

                                TRENT
                      Yes, I suppose so... - but my man, you
                      see I'm something none of you could ever
                      be... 

                                BLACK DRAGON PILOT
                      And what is that?

            Trent pours his drink and leans against the bar.

                                TRENT
                      Her equal.

            He smiles and drinks.  Only the current protection of Makiko
            keeps the Black Dragon Pilot from leaping across the table to
            throttle Trent.

            A3RTC9RUMOR7 - INT. BLACK DRAGON OUTPOST - BAR

            A SHINTO PRIEST, Kusari, wise and old sits in the corner,
            enjoying a cup of tea.  Trent walks up to him and out of some
            respect - bows.  The old man leans down a bit.

                                TRENT
                      Forgive me, but you are a Priest, are you
                      not?

            The old man nods.  Trent is quizzical, but approaches the
            subject gently.

                                TRENT (CONT'D)
                      As a Priest are you not guided by the
                      spiritual leadership of the Emperor?

            He motions for Trent to sit.  Trent does. 

                                PRIEST
                      When the Sleeper Ship first arrived in
                      Kusari space, our people were lead by the
                      Emperor - who, for three-hundred years
                      ruled with justice and in peace with the
                      help of the Minenori.  That is - until
                      the Edo family, greedy and corrupt, swore
                      to bring them down.  It was Edo Zanten
                      who assassinated the Minenori Shogun, his
                      wives and concubines, and had his
                      children murdered ---save one...a
                      boy..innocent and young... who was
                      spirited away by a group of loyal
                      Minenori warriors to a place of safety
                      among my priesthood in the Tohoku system. 
                      It was there that the young boy, Kenchi,
                      grew to manhood and swore vengeance on
                      the Edo Shogunate, in the process 
                      forming the Black Dragons.  That was over
                      two-hundred years ago.  And since that
                      time, as successive Emperor's became
                      weaker and weaker and the Edo, stronger,
                      the Black Dragons have continued to grow
                      in strength - under the ever watchful
                      care of our priests...to advise, to
                      protect, to guide.  
                          (a beat)
                      Yes, I am spiritually bound to Emperor
                      Kazuhito, but he is little more than a
                      figure head...a child who is being
                      manipulated by the Edo Shogunate. 
                      They wish to unite the leadership of the
                      Kusari through an unholy union of heirs -
                      something my true lord - Minenori Saito,
                      Kenchi's direct descendent, has sworn to
                      oppose. 
                          (a beat)
                      So, as you can see, loyalties are not
                      always easily divined are they... Mr.
                      Trent?   

            The Priest smiles in a way that only wise men can.  Trent
            nods in respect of his words. 

            A3RTC10RUMOR8A - INT. BLACK DRAGON OUTPOST - BAR

            NOTE:  HIRADA MAKIKO will sit with a male attendant, OZU,
            young aggressive, in the bar - observing Trent, but remaining
            distant and aloof.  If Trent tries to talk to her before
            having a mission, he will receive one of several blow-offs
            (probably from a distance)

                                MAKIKO
                      You are here only by my protection, don't
                      try my patience.

            A3RTC10RUMOR8B - INT. BLACK DRAGON OUTPOST - BAR

                                MAKIKO
                      Wag your tongue at me again and I'll cut
                      it out.

            A3RTC10RUMOR8C - INT. BLACK DRAGON OUTPOST - BAR

                                MAKIKO
                      Keep your distance, spy, I would just as
                      soon wash my hands of you.

            A3RTC10RUMOR8D - INT. BLACK DRAGON OUTPOST - BAR

                                MAKIKO
                      Helpful or not, I can arrange to have you
                      flushed out of the ship like the rest of
                      the garbage if you trouble me.

            A3RTC11RUMOR9A - INT. BLACK DRAGON OUTPOST - BAR

            ANGLE UP: On Trent sitting in the bar, having a drink.  He is
            sitting in a back booth.  A SMALL SOUND, a BEEPING can be
            heard.  Trent looks around.  No one else can hear it --it's
            in his head.  His eyes widen as --

            INSIDE TRENT'S MIND: WE are whisked at a frightening speed
            past intertwining tendrils color and light - until we reach
            an opening at the end --

                                                           FADE TO WHITE

            A3RTC11RUMOR9B - GIBSONIC SPACE

            The white flash fades, revealing Trent walking in a swirling
            mass of energy and ectoplasm.  Clouds drift through it and
            the sound of thunder, energy and a far off wind fill the
            space.  Lord Akiro stands in the distance, looking into a
            stunning vista of color.

                                TRENT
                          (to himself almost)
                      Lord Akiro?

            Akiro turns. 

                                LORD AKIRO
                          (calling to him)
                      I've been waiting for you, Mr. Trent.  

            Trent walks up to him.

                                TRENT
                      Where are we?  What happened to the Black
                      Dragons?

                                LORD AKIRO
                      Happened?  Nothing.  You are still with
                      them, just a portion of your mind has
                      been channeled here so we can
                      communicate.

            Trent looks around.  It dawns on him.

                                TRENT
                      My God, I'm probably in a coma or
                      something.

                                LORD AKIRO
                      Nonsense.  This isn't real.  And not
                      being real the boundaries of space and
                      time do not apply.  
                          (a beat)
                      When we are finished, you will be
                      returned to the exact instant in time you
                      answered my call.  In perfect health -
                      and no one the wiser.

            He looks Trent over.

                                LORD AKIRO (CONT'D)
                      I take it you are all right, they must
                      have believed your story.  When we lost
                      your signal I must admit my concern.

                                TRENT
                      And it took you this long to..

            Trent stops when he sees Lord Akiro's pursed lips.

                                TRENT (CONT'D)
                      I'm fine...No thanks to you.  I'm deep in
                      the Chubu system on their Station.  I
                      guess the gravity from the Gas Giant must
                      be blocking my Homer.

                                LORD AKIRO
                      That might explain why we could never
                      find them.  Is this their only outpost? 

                                TRENT
                      I don't know.  But from what little I've
                      been allowed to see, I think this is only
                      one part of something bigger.

                                LORD AKIRO
                      That would seem to validate our Intel.
                          (a beat)
                      In any case, Mr. Trent, it's time for you
                      to prove your worth to them.  The
                      Governor of Chubu, a man hated by the
                      Black Dragons, will be travelling with a
                      only a small escort to a Secret
                      Governor's meeting in Kyoto.  He is your
                      next target. 

                                TRENT
                      You want me to kill the Governor?

                                LORD AKIRO
                      No, this has all been prepared for your
                      benefit.  Naturally, it must also be
                      believable, so it will not be easy. The
                      best place to attack will be at the Jump
                      Gate to Hokkaido.  Once you destroy the
                      ships, we will release the report that
                      the Governor is dead.  We have already
                      leaked information about the Governor's
                      Meeting, so I am sure they will not
                      refuse the opportunity to test your
                      information.
                          (a beat)
                      Good luck.

            The sound of rushing waters as...

            A3RTC11RUMOR9C - INT. BLACK DRAGON OUTPOST - BAR

            We fade back into the bar where Trent is restored to his own
            body. His quickly glances around and sees that things and
            people are exactly as he left them.  He goes back to his
            drink with the look of a man with a secret.

            A3RTC12RUMOR10- INT. BLACK DRAGON OUTPOST - BAR

            (Note: Now the scene with Makiko will play.)

            Trent walks up to Hirada Makiko and Ozu, who sit in their
            usual place. 

                                TRENT
                      I have News.

            She looks up at him.  So?, she seems to say. 

            ANGLE ON: CLOSE UP Trent holding up a DATACHIP between his
            fingers.  He turns it in front of his face and then pitches
            it in front of Makiko. 

            ANGEL ON: Makiko watching the chip hit the table.  She
            glances over at Ozu, who pops it into a handheld viewer. 

            It beeps to life - after a moment.

                                OZU
                          (with some disbelief)
                      He has the Governor of Chubu's
                      coordinates.

            She raises an eyebrow at this.  Impressive or suspicious.

                                MAKIKO
                      I myself only just heard about the
                      meeting.  Your contacts work quickly, Mr.
                      Trent.

            A long moment pauses as she tries to read his sneer.

                                MAKIKO (CONT'D)
                      We will go.  But you will also come,
                      Bretonian.  

                                TRENT
                      I wouldn't have it any other way.

                                MAKIKO
                      If this is a trap I will kill you myself.

            They lock eyes.  Trent tips his head.  Fine.

            See Mission Pack.

            Note: In space, the beeping sound can be heard --after all
            enemies are destroyed.  Moment later Trent is in...

            A3RTC13RUMOR11 - GIBSONIC SPACE 

            The White recedes and Trent turns around and sees Lord Akiro
            a ways away.

                                TRENT
                          (concerned - calling to him)
                      Hey, I'm in the middle of something here! 
                      Come on!

                                LORD AKIRO (O.S.)
                          (gently)
                      I can hear you perfectly, Mr. Trent.

            Akiro walks up from behind him as if he was there all along. 
            Trent jumps and looks to where Akiro was.  Nothing.  Wind.
            Akiro is smiling --perhaps the first time Trent has seen
            this.  Did he just play a joke on him?  Trent watches him
            closely.

                                LORD AKIRO (CONT'D)
                      As I said, no boundaries..no
                      barriers...this won't take long.  I
                      wanted to congratulate you on your
                      apparent victory - the Governor is now
                      dead to the world.  But now, we must up
                      the stakes.

                                TRENT
                      Now?

            Akiro looks at his chronometer on his wrist.

                                LORD AKIRO
                      Right now.
                          (a beat)
                      There is an outpost in the Kyoto system -
                      one that your new friends know well as a
                      place in which allegedly many secret
                      meetings take place --they just haven't
                      had the advance knowledge of who would be
                      there and when.  We will give them that. 

                                TRENT
                      Why?  Who's there?

                                LORD AKIRO
                      All of our Top Military Commanders.  They
                      are meeting there at this moment to
                      discuss the grave threat that Rheinland
                      poses.  Ironic isn't it?

            This nags Trent a bit --it's too convincing.

                                TRENT
                      You're sure they're not really there,
                      right?

            As if he didn't hear.

                                LORD AKIRO
                      Good bye, Mr. Trent.

            Akiro is smiling again as Trent finds himself...

            Back in Space...exactly where he was a second ago....

            Note: Trent Comms. Makiko with this new information and they
            divert to take out the Station in Kyoto.

            See Mission Pack.

            After their success - Trent follows the Black Dragons into
            the huge asteroid as the gate opens, revealing the Secret
            Headquarters of the Black Dragons in Tohoku.  He lands on the
            -

            A3RTC14 - INT. HIDDEN TOHOKU BASE  - LANDING PAD (PLAYS)

            The ships land on the amazingly well stocked deck.  Weapons
            and ships from all over.  Trent emerges from his ship.  There
            are Black Dragons surging from their ships and on deck.  As
            he looks at them on his ramp, he notices Makiko approaching
            him.  The others part to allow her through.  She walks up the
            ramp and meets him half way.  Trent says nothing.  What is
            this?  He can't read her.

            The lock eyes.  Makiko slowly bows her head in more than
            professional respect but restrained gratitude, then back up. 
            Trent, who does not smile, does the same.  It is moment that
            two fighters share.  A voice from far away makes her look up
            and behind her.

                                SAZUKE
                      Hirada Makiko!

            Trent also looks and sees a Kusari man in his mid-forties,
            greying mustache and black uniform, standing on a railed
            platform (from which a Black Dragon banner is suspended) high
            above the deck.  His eyes are cold and dark - but pleased to
            see her.  This is TOHO SAZUKE, the Black Dragon Leader. 

            She runs from Trent without looking back.

            Trent watches her.

            She appears on the deck and bows deeply to the older man.  He
            raises her head and looks at her like a daughter.  They
            smile.

            Trent takes a few steps and is swept out of frame, despite
            his protests.

            A3RTC15 - INT. HIDDEN TOHOKU BASE  - LOUNGE

            As Trent enters the lounge, filled with Black Dragons, he
            hears the sound of a News Broadcast in progress.  All eyes,
            including his, are on the large staticy monitor as it
            continues, playing images of fire and debris, people running
            on a deck, Kusari fighters lifting off, faces of officials. 
            The Kusari Newscaster continues.

                                KUSARI NEWSCASTER (V.O.)
                      -a day of unprecedented chaos and
                      destruction visited upon the peaceful
                      people of Kusari as news of the loss of
                      Chubu's beloved leader, Governor Noshu
                      reached their ears.  And tonight a
                      government retreat lay twisted and in
                      ruins as it was also viciously attacked -
                      killing all that were on board her. 
                      There has been no confirmation as of yet,
                      but it is believed that our Colonies'
                      Chief Military minds may have been in
                      session at the site. 
                      We here - are in shock...and though the
                      Shogun voiced his outrage, demanding an
                      immediate investigation, a source that
                      spoke on the condition of anonymity
                      blamed the recent events on the Kusari
                      reactionaries,the Black Dragons...  

            The whole room CHEERS! - drowning out whatever else she might
            have said.  The room is abuzz as the News goes off.

            Trent walks up to the bar and the BLACK DRAGON BARTENDER
            pours him a drink.  He knows who he is.  He bows as he hands
            it to him with both hands.  Trent tips his head back and
            takes a drink. As he looks across the bar he sees Ozu,
            sitting by himself - stoic - glaring at him.  This catches
            him in mid-swallow.  This can't be good.  He slowly turns his
            back on him, trying to let it slide.

                                MAKIKO (O.S.)
                      Mr. Trent.

            He turns around - what now.

            He sees Makiko standing with Sazuke, an impressive figure,
            with a cane, obviously for some old injury to his leg.  Trent
            takes a step, so do they.  

                                MAKIKO (CONT'D)
                      Please meet our Leader, Toho Sazuke.

            Trent bows, Sazuke nods, eyes gazing into Trent.

                                SAZUKE
                          (re: the News and the crowd)
                      Evidence of your handiwork, Mr. Trent.  I
                      feel we may have made the right decision
                      in trusting you after all.

            Trent is being crushed by the older man's stare. All he can
            manage is...

                                TRENT
                      ...Thank you, sir.

            Makiko takes Sazuke by the arm and after nodding their good
            byes, he escorts him out.  Trent stands amid the rabble.

            ANGLE ON: Slowly Crane up and away as Trent surveys the room,
            surrounded by people, but totally alone.

                                KUSARI NEWSCASTER (V.O.)
                      With the News of the brutal attacks at
                      home, Governor Tekagi is returning home
                      after several days of closed door
                      sessions with the Kaiser on Bismarck.  So
                      far, neither side has issued a statement
                      of what was decided, but security around
                      the Governor's return is very high.

            A3RTC16RUMOR12 - INT. HIDDEN TOHOKU BASE - LOUNGE

            Trent sees the glaring Ozu, sitting in the corner, obviously
            lit and nursing a bottle. Trent slowly walks over.  After
            moment of abject silence - with Trent waiting for something:

                                TRENT
                      What?  
                      (a beat)
                      Can I help you?

            Ozu says nothing.  Obviously not.  Trent shakes his head and
            is about to go -

                                OZU
                          (slowly)
                      I know who you are.

            Trent is unflinching, but he could be in trouble.

                                TRENT
                      You do, do you.

            Ozu nods.

                                OZU
                      You are the devil.

                                TRENT
                      The devil?

                                OZU
                      These victories are coming too
                      easily..Makiko, even Toho-san is blind to
                      this...

                                TRENT
                      You've had too much to drink, pal.  I'm
                      no devil.

                                OZU
                          (a sudden burst of energy)
                      Where do you get your information then? 
                      Why is it I cannot track your
                      transmissions?  --Can you really desire
                      to reinstate the Minenori family?

            Trent is steel.  

                                TRENT
                      Why not?

            Satisfied that he's safe, Trent turns to walk away.  

            CLOSE UP ON: Ozu.

                                OZU
                          (to Trent's back)
                      -And what will the devil want in return
                      for this miracle?  

            ANGLE ON: Trent in fg of a combo two shot.

                                TRENT 
                          (away from Ozu - solemnly)
                      To go home.

            The last word carries with it ALL of the connotations that he
            is missing right now.  He leaves Ozu to his bottle.

            A3RTC17RUMOR13A - INT. HIDDEN TOHOKU BASE - FLIGHT DECK

            Trent goes for a walk on the flight deck, passing a few Black
            Dragons who silently greet him.  

            The Beeping sound in his head.

                                                           FADE TO WHITE

            A3RTC17RUMOR13B - GIBSONIC SPACE 

            Trent stands wanders though the cloudy room.  There is an
            unearthly sound of echoy voices being stretched and played
            backwards - coming from nothing - going to nothing as Trent
            speaks.

                                TRENT
                      Lord Akiro?  Where are you?

            He looks around.  Sound of the wind and distant thunder. 
            Akiro's voice is in the thunder --it is everywhere.

                                LORD AKIRO (O.S.)
                          (booming)
                      You have done well, Mr. Trent.

            Trent still can't see him. 

                                TRENT
                          (shouting)
                      I don't know how much longer I can do
                      this.

                                LORD AKIRO
                          (booming)
                      Why not? They trust you, don't they?

                                TRENT
                      That's not it...

            Akiro's face appears against the swirling landscape.  HUGE -
            Akiro's head and shoulders are as big as a mountain. 
            Thunder.

                                LORD AKIRO
                          (booming)
                      Do not forget, Mr. Trent, these are
                      dangerous terrorists --they represent a
                      grave threat to us all.

            CLOSE UP ANGLE ON: Trent is dumbstruck by this site.  HE
            suddenly feels a hand on his shoulder.  He spins and sees it
            is Akiro, smiling.  

                                LORD AKIRO (CONT'D)
                          (calmly)
                      Besides...once this is accomplished, I
                      can then help you in your quest.

            Trent considers this.

                                LORD AKIRO (CONT'D)
                      Where are you right now?

                                TRENT
                      In their base - in Tohoku.

                                LORD AKIRO
                      Tohoku?...That's where we lost you.

                                TRENT
                      It's hidden in an asteroid.  It looks
                      like they've been here a long time.

                                LORD AKIRO
                      Their Home Base...

            Trent slowly nods.

                                LORD AKIRO (CONT'D)
                      You will tell them that Shogun Edo is
                      retreating to his summer home in Kanto. 
                      He will travel under escort, but he will
                      have sent most of his personal guard to
                      reinforce his defenses in Honshu.  There
                      is an ice field near Kanto --he will be
                      most vulnerable there.  The Black Dragons
                      will view this as a tactical opportunity
                      they cannot resist.  

            Trent exhales.  His emotions are mixed.

                                LORD AKIRO (CONT'D)
                      Do not worry.  It's almost over.  
                          (a beat)
                      You have planted the seed, my friend, now
                      it is time to strike.

            A3RTC18 - INT. HIDDEN TOHOKU BASE - LOUNGE (PLAYS)

            Up from white.  For a moment, the Camera is on an opaque
            surface, light - washed out.  We don't know where this is.

            Suddenly - Toho Sazuke stands into a close up.  He is
            agitated.  Barely keeping himself composed.

                                SAZUKE
                          (shouting)
                      KANTO!!??

            ANGLE ON:  A large corner table in the lounge where Sazuke is
            holding court: Makiko - closest to Sazuke, several other
            lieutenants sit around them and Ozu stands behind  - not part
            of the circle.  Trent is standing before them.  He keeps eye
            contact with the angry Leader.  

                                SAZUKE (CONT'D)
                          (shouting)
                      Are you mad!?

            Makiko reaches up and puts a hand on the Leader's arm to
            settle him.  He cools outwardly, having been reminded how
            this looks to his men...his eyes narrow on Trent. Ozu looks
            expectant - eyes bright.

                                TRENT
                      I have it on good authority that the
                      Shogun Edo, himself, will be there.

            This renews Sazuke's boil.

                                SAZUKE
                      Shogun Edo?! The most guarded man in the
                      Colony - -!

                                TRENT
                          (interrupting - calmly)
                      -The most ripe fruit for the Black
                      Dragons to pick from the vine.  
                          (a beat)
                      He's been advised to expect a Rheinland
                      advance in Honshu.  He's sent most of his
                      men there to fortify his reserves.

            Sazuke lets this settle in.  It makes some sense - cooling
            him.  He sits back down slowly.  Ozu watches this -- Trent is
            the devil.

                                TRENT (CONT'D)
                      He's vulnerable now, my Lord.

            Trent holds up a Datachip...and hands it to Makiko.

            ANGLE UP ON: Ozu in bg as he watches the exchange of the
            datachip large in fg.  The chip changes hands and he closes
            his eyes and dips his head in defeat.  Trent has sealed their
            fate.

            Sazuke mulls this over.

                                SAZUKE
                          (sotto)
                      Edo...at last.

            Sazuke stands again.

                                SAZUKE (CONT'D)
                          (to his lieutenants)
                      I want all of our forces mobilized. There
                      can be no mistakes.   
                          (louder)
                      This day - we repay a thousand debts. 
                      Long live Minenori Saito!

            Fists go up all over.  The bar erupts. (Except for Ozu who
            runs off)

                                ALL
                      Long live Minenori Saito!

            Pandemonium.  Trent glances around - silent.  Sazuke looks
            elated - he nods to Trent, proud.  Trent returns his nod once
            in respect.  Seeing this, Makiko even smiles slightly.  

            MISSION 15

            See Mission Pack.

            * The Black Dragons are destroyed - utterly.

            * Sazuke - wanting a piece of the Shogun, too - dies.

            * Makiko - betrayed and enraged - engages Trent in the fight
            of his life - and is also killed.

            * Ozu - who has managed to survive until now - takes a
            suicide run at Trent, determined to regain honor for his
            people.  Trent somehow manages to avoid this.

            On the way back, in Space:

            Trent hears the familiar beeping.

                                                           FADE TO WHITE

            A3RTC19RUMOR14 - GIBSONIC SPACE 

            Trent finds himself standing in the swirling world.  He looks
            off into the distance at a distant storm of energy and color. 
            He is silent. He just looks down.  This has taken its toll on
            him.

            CLOSE ON: Trent looking off. 3/4 profile.

            Lord Akiro joins him in profile, looking off.  Neither one
            says anything for a moment.

                                LORD AKIRO
                          (solemnly)
                      It's never easy - even when it's
                      necessary.

            Trent knows that he's talking about killing.  He doesn't
            look.

                                LORD AKIRO (CONT'D)
                      This is the burden of leadership..making
                      such decisions...Who is to live, who is
                      to die.

                                TRENT
                          (flatly)
                      Is it right?

                                LORD AKIRO
                      That is the burden of the politician.  I
                      am not one of those, thankfully.

            Trent finally turns to Akiro.

            ANGLES ON: Them both, close.

                                TRENT
                      I think I'll take my payment now, Akiro.

            Akiro looks at him deeply.  Finally, he nods.

                                LORD AKIRO
                      I will arrange for you to get what it is
                      you have come for.
                          (a beat)
                      Wait until I contact you again.  For now
                      enjoy what pleasures Kusari has to offer
                      you, Mr. Trent.

            On: Trent.

                                TRENT
                      Where would I go?

            Trent remembers the last time he heard that.

                      It's war!  Unbridled aggression from
                      Rheinland has forced Kusari to close
                      their gates and fortify security around
                      the Colony.  War.  The bitter weed that
                      drove our ancestors from SOL centuries
                      ago has sprung anew from Rheinland soil.
                      The Shogunate has issued a warning
                      advisory to all neutral ships traveling
                      through Kusari and Rheinland space -
                      though heightened Kusari patrols will not
                      prevent their passage, such travel is not
                      advised at this time.

                      Government sources assure the public that
                      despite the present tensions with
                      Rheinland, their attention to domestic
                      affairs has not diminished. They cite a
                      recent incident in which the notorious
                      Black Dragons were brought to their knees
                      and then to ultimate justice at the hands
                      of righteous Kusari security forces.  And
                      in a surprise revelation, they assure the
                      public that previous reports that
                      Governor Noshu and other Kusari officials
                      had been assassinated or were threatened
                      in any way were erroneous and were meant
                      only to mislead the terrorists - known to
                      tap into Kusari News and Information. 
                      We, ourselves, apologize for any concern
                      our reporting of the facts due to

            Note: Where ever Trent may be in Kusari Space, he hears the
            beeping and his vision goes to WHITE.

                                                      FADE UP FROM WHITE:

            Trent appears in the familiar swirling space.  He approaches
            Lord Akiro with purpose. This is old hat to Trent now.

            ANGLE ON: Trent - Walks into Medium Close Up.

                                TRENT
                          (to the point)
                      What have you found?

            Akiro is slightly taken aback by Trent's directness.

                                LORD AKIRO
                      I am afraid that what you want from me is
                      quite elusive. 
                          (a beat)
                      Mr. Trent, the climate has changed....

                                TRENT
                      I'm not interested.  We have a deal-

                                LORD AKIRO
                          (cutting him off)
                      -And I will remain faithful to it...

            Sound of LOUD thunder.  Akiro looks up.

                                LORD AKIRO (CONT'D)
                          (to Trent)
                      You will meet me in the Honshu system at
                      the coordinates I will send you.

            His last words echo slightly over -

            ANGEL ON: Trent -surprised - suddenly walking to where Akiro
            was, now just vapor.  Trent shouts to him.

                                TRENT
                      Dammit, Akiro. Come back here.

                                                           FADE TO WHITE

            Note: Trent's vision fades up from white to wherever he was
            before.

            He flies to meet Akiro at the coordinates of the LARGE KUSARI
            BATTLESHIP, overlooking the Honshu jump gate. There are many
            fighters around, accenting the Kusari's buildup for war. 
            When Trent is in range of the Battleship, it contacts him and
            says that Lord Akiro is expecting him.  He picks up an escort
            the rest of the way.

            Trent lands on the - 

            A3RTC21A - INT. KUSARI BATTLESHIP - FLIGHT DECK

            Trent gets out of his ship and is surprised to see the deck
            alive with the kind of activity that war is about:  People,
            cargo, weapons, ships - assembled yet in flux, somehow linked
            in joint purpose.

            NOISE of machines and techs working, particularly on a large
            engine- that is being tested.  It whines, as two Kusari Elite
            Guards approach Trent, MOS.  He knows why they are there. 
            One of them extends his arm in the direction of the Lounge. 
            Trent, resigned that he is going to have to be escorted by
            these two, finally makes a face and gestures - Fine, let's go
            already!  They walk off.

            A3RTC21B - INT. KUSARI BATTLESHIP - LOUNGE (PLAYS)

            LOW ANGLE ON: Table at which Lord Akiro sits alone with his
            thoughts.  In fg.
            Trent and his escorts step in front of him - a guard and
            Trent framing him as silhouettes to the bright lighting of
            his table.  He looks up at Trent - we cannot read him - and
            then, without a word he dismisses the soldiers with a head
            gesture - get out.  He watches them go with his eyes.  Once
            they are gone -  

                                LORD AKIRO
                      I am pleased to see you Mr. Trent, even
                      under these circumstances -

                                TRENT
                          (cutting him off)
                      Let's get to it, Akiro.  You brought me
                      here - and here I am...why?

                                LORD AKIRO
                          (calming)
                      Please, Mr. Trent, sit down.

                                TRENT
                          (sharply)
                      I think I'll stand.

            Akiro sees that something is bothering Trent.  He thinks he
            knows what it is.

                                LORD AKIRO
                      I understand how you feel, Mr. Trent.

                                TRENT
                      You used me, Akiro.

                                LORD AKIRO
                      To rid us of a group of dangerous
                      fanatics.

                                TRENT
                      Yeah, a group of dangerous and fanatic
                      women and children..like those in hiding
                      in Tohoku. 

                                LORD AKIRO
                          (getting sharp)
                      And the families of those they murdered?
                      The innocent women and children they 
                      needlessly slaughtered?  No, the Black
                      Dragons were a threat - greater even than
                      The Order.

            Trent sees an element of passion coming through.  Akiro calms
            himself.

                                LORD AKIRO (CONT'D)
                      And now we are being threatened by
                      Rheinland. 

            Several soldiers walk by.

                                TRENT
                          (re: the soldiers)
                      You seem well equipped for that.

            Akiro shakes his head.

                                LORD AKIRO
                      It appears that Tekagi's attempts to sue
                      for peace, were merely being tolerated by
                      the Kaiser to buy him time.

            Trent's look, Akiro motions for him to sit.  This time he
            does.  Akiro leans in.

                                LORD AKIRO (CONT'D)
                          (sotto)
                      I've just received word from our
                      operative inside Rheinland, that the
                      Kaiser has developed some kind of a
                      weapon.  Something devastating.  Which he
                      intends to use against us.

                                TRENT
                      Who else knows?

                                LORD AKIRO
                      Only a precious few.  If Rheinland were
                      to find out what we know, our contact
                      would be quickly eliminated.

            Dawns on Trent.

                                TRENT
                          (suspicious)
                      Why tell me then?

                                LORD AKIRO
                      Our operative has managed to secret away
                      vital information about this weapon in
                      the hopes of getting it to us. 
                      Regrettably, a previous attempt to
                      contact him failed and our agent was
                      killed.  Now, it appears we need to not
                      only get the information but also get our
                      man out and back to Kusari space.  I want
                      you to do it. 

                                TRENT
                      Me?  I don't want to do it.  I through
                      with this.

                                LORD AKIRO
                      Mr. Trent, Rheinland won't stop with us. 
                      He intends to also take on Bretonia and
                      then Liberty. 

                                TRENT
                      Can he do that?

                                LORD AKIRO
                      We believe so.

            After a moment, Trent reluctantly nods his head.

                                LORD AKIRO (CONT'D)
                      We are in your gratitude.  The man you
                      will find is Marcus Von Claussen, a
                      Rheinland aristocrat sympathetic to our
                      cause.  I will make arrangements - You
                      will leave for Bismarck at once.

                                TRENT
                      I want what I came for.

                                LORD AKIRO
                      And you shall have it.  Be patient, I
                      have taken your request to the top
                      sources that I have.  Please trust me,
                      Mr. Trent.

            Trent gets up to go, then remembers.

                                TRENT
                      How will I find this Von Claussen?

                                LORD AKIRO
                      He will find you.

                      The War spreads to Liberty!  In what has
                      been described as an intolerable act of
                      open aggression, warships from Rheinland
                      penetrated and attacked targets in New

                      declared War on Rheinland in retaliation
                      of this act of supreme defiance, issuing
                      orders for all Rheinland citizens within
                      their borders to be escorted out.  Though
                      she declined to answer questions specific
                      to the attack, she did confirm that some
                      Liberty military interests may have been
                      affected.  Sources within Kusari, who
                      spoke on condition of anonymity, have
                      said that the well-known military
                      installation, Zone 21, was the target of
                      the attack. They also report that Liberty

            Trent finds a high-level KUSARI DIPLOMAT in the bar.  He is
            thin, almost skeletal, with an air of sneakiness about him.

                                KUSARI DIPLOMAT
                          (quietly)
                      I wish to thank you.

                                TRENT
                      What for?

                                KUSARI DIPLOMAT
                          (quietly)
                      Rumor in certain circles has it that the
                      Black Dragons fell with the help of a
                      Bretonian A Bretonian matching your
                      description.

            The Diplomat smiles slyly.

                                TRENT
                      You've got the wrong guy, pal.

            He knows it's Trent, but he'll play the game.

                                KUSARI DIPLOMAT
                          (undaunted)
                      I, of course, understand the need to keep
                      such things quiet, nevertheless, you have
                      my gratitude.

            The Diplomat dips his head.  Trent exhales loudly and walks
            off.

                      Rheinland ships are said to have been
                      responsible for an assault on a cargo
                      vessel en route from Leeds in Bretonia to
                      a government depot set aside for Artifact
                      collection.  Rheinland flatly denies
                      these allegations, reaffirming their
                      cooperative relationship with Bretonia. 
                      Investigators admit that the eyewitness
                      testimony from the few survivors may be
                      unreliable due to the extensive injuries
                      they sustained, however, they say that
                      these claims are being treated as serious
                      until more evidence can be uncovered.

                      Much of the market is waiting to see what
                      happens.  You do realize that it is just
                      a matter of time until Rheinland decides
                      to comes through the jump gate.  Many of
                      us are resigned to this fact --and we
                      will do whatever is necessary.  We have
                      always supported the Shogunate and their
                      wisdom to lead us through whatever is set
                      before us.  So as it was, is and shall
                      be.

            When Trent arrives in Rheinland space, he sees the very
            militaristic atmosphere.  Ships and blockades abound.  He is
            scanned repeatedly, but allowed to pass.

            When he lands on Bismarck-

            Trent gets out of ship and surveys the surroundings.  Yes,
            there are plenty of Guards and propaganda, but most of the
            people seem fine --all just doing what they do.

            On the deck, suddenly hears the familiar beeping sound, it's
            Akiro.

                                                          FADE TO WHITE:

            A3RTC24RUMOR18B - GIBSONIC SPACE

            Trent appears in front of Akiro.

                                LORD AKIRO
                      Mr. Trent, I see you have made it
                      Bismarck.  Excellent.  I wanted to let
                      you know that Governor Tekagi himself has
                      contacted me with information about your
                      need.

                                TRENT
                          (surprised)
                      Governor Tekagi?  You took this to him?

                                LORD AKIRO
                      I told you to be patient, my friend. 
                      Tekagi is a trusted associate of mine and
                      the Shogun now denies him nothing.  He
                      will serve our needs well.

            Trent looks relieved, then perhaps ashamed.

                                TRENT
                          (haltingly)
                      Lord Akiro, I want you to know...when I
                      accused you of using me, I just...I'm
                      sorry if I...

            Akiro nods.

                                LORD AKIRO
                      Stop.  There is no need.  You and I serve
                      the same side, Mr. Trent.
                          (a beat)
                      What you must know now is that I have
                      also made contact with Von Claussen.  He
                      says that even as a neutral in Rheinland
                      you will surely be followed.  Something
                      our previous agent did not know and
                      suffered for.  Von Claussen is making
                      arrangements for you but they may take
                      some time - he suggests that you conduct
                      yourself as a Freelancer in the trading
                      business until it is safe.  I will
                      contact you again.  Good luck, Mr. Trent.

            OF LATE AFTERNOON (PLAYS)

            From white, Trent finds himself were he was before.  He looks
            around, now cautious, and exits frame.

            As he does, a SHADOW of someone behind him, stretches across
            the deck.  The Camera tilts down on it and moves in slowly. 
            We do not see who this is.

            Feet appear in frame, going in the same direction as Trent. 
            They stop in frame. A cigarette falls and is crushed out. 
            The feet continue after Trent.  Who is this?

            Trent sees a RHEINLAND DIPLOMAT, youngish and steely, who
            singles Trent out, loudly.

                                RHEINLAND DIPLOMAT
                      Bretonian!  

            Trent's eyes widen as he notices that every head in the bar
            has turned. The Diplomat stands raising his drink.

                                RHEINLAND DIPLOMAT (CONT'D)
                      You must join me for a drink.  Surely you
                      have been through the other systems
                      recently, you must tell me how Rheinland
                      is seen through the eyes of the others.
                      Tell me.  --Tell us all!

            Trent fights back an urge to speak his mind as he looks
            around and sees people looking at him, expectantly.

                                TRENT
                          (sotto)
                      I wouldn't know. It isn't my business.

            The Diplomat cocks his head and puts a hand to his ear. 

                                RHEINLAND DIPLOMAT
                      I'm sorry, what did you say? We can't
                      hear you.  LOUDER!

            Trent becomes ice.

                                TRENT
                          (slowly and louder)
                      I said - None of this is my business.

                                RHEINLAND DIPLOMAT
                          (to the room)
                      I told you.  The Bretonians have no belly
                      for the realities of political
                      revolution.  They are a race of fops, as
                      cowardly as their Queen.

            The room titters with laughter.

            ANGLE ON: Trent making a fist at his side.  His eyes darken
            but he keeps his composure. 

            The Rheinland Diplomat walks right up to him.  In his face.

                                RHEINLAND DIPLOMAT (CONT'D)
                          (sotto)
                      Tell me, Bretonian, will you be so
                      carefully neutral when we make your
                      palace a brothel and your Queen it's
                      biggest whore? Hmm?

            The Rheinland Diplomat grins in Trent's face.  Trent may
            boil.  He decides to walk away.  The Diplomat steps right
            back in front of him.

                                RHEINLAND DIPLOMAT (CONT'D)
                          (whispering)
                      Watch yourself, Bretonian, the Shogun
                      will bow to the Kaiser soon.  Your Queen
                      will then fall to his might...and we will
                      not stop until he takes his rightful
                      place in the seat of power in the halls
                      of Liberty.

            Trent walks past him and out of frame.  

            CLOSE ON: The Diplomat.

                                RHEINLAND DIPLOMAT (CONT'D)
                          (to the room)
                      Everyone drink!  Drink to the spineless
                      Bretonian!  Run home to your Queen mother

                      Greetings people of Rheinland, we are
                      united we are one! 
                      Before being destroyed, probes from the
                      Ministry of Strategic Information
                      revealed that the in another unprovoked
                      act of aggression, the Kusari government
                      has staged a massive attack force behind
                      the Honshu jump gate, with the clear
                      intent to invade. The Kaiser himself
                      urges his people to remain calm and
                      stresses that he will not allow any such
                      actions.  He also says that he has reason
                      to believe that the Kusari may not be
                      acting alone in these matters.  Let us
                      support the Kaiser and his strength to
                      assure a peaceful and just Rheinland.  We
                      are united, we are one!

                      This place is coming apart.  How long do
                      I have to keep this up?

                      All is ready, Von Claussen will contact
                      you in the Bismarck Tavern.

                      Don't worry, Mr. Trent.  Von Claussen is 
                      a smart man.  He knows what he's doing.

            Trent enters the smoky, loud tavern looking for Von Claussen. 
            As he looks around, the room grows silent as JONNER, a well
            spoken and dramatic barker and a BLIX, a Monk, wide eyed and
            crazy looking - a Rasputin character, take the center stage
            in the room.  The lights seem to go down as the cabaret-style
            act begins. 

                                JONNER
                      Since the time before Sol, we have been
                      fascinated by the spirit world.  Long
                      have we craved undeniable proof of its
                      existence and coveted its favors, be it
                      peopled by devils or saints, whoever
                      these denizens of the spirit world. 
                      "What does my future hold?", we ask.
                      "Help me in battle this day..Pray, let
                      not my body be consumed by rot or worm or
                      fire."

            Then - he points to his friend, who bows.

                                JONNER (CONT'D)
                      Let me present, Mr. Blix.  Though he is
                      more or less mute to the average man, he
                      speaks in the rhythms of the celestial
                      heavens - acutely attuned to the spirit
                      realms. 

            Blix closes his eyes and puts his hands together.

                                JONNER (CONT'D)
                      He has made contact, they share with him,
                      the intimate secrets of how the universe
                      truly works in all of its divine
                      machinations...See as he now intermingles
                      his fleshly form with that of the
                      noncorporeal...

            The Monk begins to softly chant and his eyes roll back in a
            trance.  The crowd gasps as he begins to rise- levitate in
            the air.  Jonner walks around him, working the crowd.

                      They spirit his very essence, holding him
                      aloft...and as warriors for eons past
                      have begged, neither allow harm nor the
                      very creaturehood of death to so much as
                      touch his body..as you can see!

            Jonner produces a small cannister and points it at the
            floating Blix.  FIRE erupts from it like a flamethrower,
            engulfing the floating Blix in mass of plasma and making his
            body an inferno.  The crowd screams!  

                                JONNER (CONT'D)
                      Behold!

            Blix holds his arms out, making him look like a flaming
            scarecrow.  He begins to turn slowly.

            ANGLE ON: Trent illuminated by firelight.

                                JONNER (CONT'D)
                      ENOUGH!

            Jonner produces a POPCICLE, a compact cold unit - it sprays a
            cloud of cold vapor on the Monk --PSSSST!   After a moment,
            he seems to disappear as the dense pillar collapses into an
            eerie cloud of vapor, which hangs above the floor a few feet. 

            It falls below Jonner's waist and he moves to the front of
            the crowd. Swirling.

            CLOSE ANGLE ON: Jonner.

                                JONNER (CONT'D)
                      And like Lazarus from the grave...

            He turns and extends his hand towards the floor.

                                JONNER (CONT'D)
                      The spirits will deliver Mr. Blix...from
                      pain...

            CLOSE ANGLE ON: Blix's hand rising from the mist.

                                JONNER (CONT'D)
                      From disfigurement..and..from the very
                      grip of death.  
                          (suddenly)
                      HAZZAH!

            Blix's body bolts up from laying down to standing straight - 
            without bending, causing everyone to jump - even Trent.  Blix
            is unharmed, still entranced.

                                JONNER (CONT'D)
                      All for your amusement...

            He snaps his fingers and Blix shakes it off.

                                JONNER (CONT'D)
                      And your kind patronage...

            They both bow.  Massive applause.  The sound of credits
            flying.

            Trent applauds.

            ANGLE ON:  Blix, who gets a flash of recognition.  He leans
            to Jonner.

                                JONNER (CONT'D)
                          (to the crowd)
                      Thank you.  Thank you.

            Blix whispers to Jonner, who then notices Trent. He narrows
            his eyes, while still raking in credits.

            The lights come up and the room goes back to normal.

            A3RTC27B - INT. BISMARCK TAVERN 

            Trent sits down at a corner table, still looking for Von
            Claussen. Jonner and Blix walk up.

                                JONNER
                      My good sir, may we interest you in a
                      reading for what the future may hold for
                      you?

                                TRENT
                      No thank you.  

            Blix doesn't take his eyes off of him.

                                JONNER
                      Contact the dead departed...

            Trent shakes his head.

                                JONNER (CONT'D)
                          (finally - to the point)
                      Help you find someone.

            Trent narrows his eyes.  Still -

                                TRENT
                      No.

                                JONNER
                      Mr. Blix here is never wrong about such
                      things.  He says you are looking for
                      someone.  For Herr Von Claussen.

                                TRENT
                      Does he speak for himself?

            Blix looks at Jonner, who nods.  Blix simply opens his mouth
            and a MAD cacophony of voices - men, women, children, of all
            ages and levels of intensity stream out.  It's an insane
            rush.  He closes his mouth and it suddenly stops.  Jonner
            looks back to a surprised Trent.

                                JONNER
                      Mr. Blix has connections to sources on a
                      higher plane, shall we say. 

                                TRENT
                      And what about you.

                                JONNER
                      No, not I, sir. I was gifted with being a 
                      "listener".  Together we are the eyes and
                      ears for certain people who are willing
                      to pay for such divine services.  
                          ( a beat)
                      We are in the employ of one such man now. 
                      The man you seek.  You see we have been
                      waiting for you for sometime.

                                TRENT
                      Why?

                                JONNER
                      To deliver a message.

            Then.

                                TRENT
                          (suspicious)
                      I see.  And what if I said you had the
                      wrong man?

            Jonner looks to Blix who shakes his head.

                                JONNER
                          (to Trent)
                      He would know, sir. There is no mistake.
                          (a beat - sotto)
                      You are to meet Herr Von Claussen on the
                      old terraforming platform on the planet
                      Abe....in the Hamburg system.

                                TRENT
                      When?

            Blix leans in and whispers to Jonner.

                                JONNER
                      Don't worry, Mr. Trent, the Gods are
                      smiling upon you...when you get there the
                      time will be right.

            Jonner puts his hand on Trent's shoulder.

            SUDDEN TIME DILATED FLASH: Jonner's hand coming away from
            Trent's shoulder, then his fingers, then finally his index,
            then deeper - revealing a tiny PIECE OF HARDWARE that Jonner
            has affixed to Trent's clothes. It blinks once.  A
            Transmitter.

                                RHEINLAND NEWSCASTER (V.O.)
                      Greetings people of Rheinland, we are
                      united we are one!  Sources inside our
                      beloved Kaiser's office say that though
                      the power hungry President of Liberty has
                      severed all diplomatic ties with us -
                      obviously in preparation for war, unrest
                      toils in her own house as several high
                      ranking officers and officials have
                      separated from her and say that she has
                      acted without support or recommendation. 
                      They claim that this is a personal
                      vendetta and they will not support her. 
                      Our sources also claim that this story
                      has been utterly suppressed by the iron
                      fist of the Liberty media.  We are
                      grateful to the Kaiser for his unyielding
                      commitment to freedom of information.  We
                      are united, we are one!

            A3RTC28RUMOR21 - ANY RHEINLAND TAVERN

            Trent walks up and holds up to the bar, noiselessly ordering
            a drink from the RHEINLAND BARTENDER.  He hears a voice to
            his right.  

                                FEMALE RHEINLAND PILOT (O.S.)
                      I don't remember seeing you in here
                      before.

            Trent looks in the direction of the voice and sees a
            beautiful FEMALE RHEINLAND PILOT, 20.  She gently sips her
            drink.  

                                TRENT
                      I've been around.

                                FEMALE RHEINLAND PILOT
                      No doubt.  

            She smiles.

                                FEMALE RHEINLAND PILOT (CONT'D)
                      You know, with all of this foolishness,
                      the number of interesting people around
                      here has dropped to just about zero.

            Off Trent's look.

                                FEMALE RHEINLAND PILOT (CONT'D)
                      This has all been very sudden, our
                      leadership used to be very level headed
                      and benign.  Now, recently it's been
                      nothing but Kaiser this..Kaiser
                      that...blah - blah - blah.

            Trent looks around the bar, then back to her.

                                TRENT
                      I'd think that talk like that would get
                      you into trouble.

                                FEMALE RHEINLAND PILOT
                      Oh, you'd be surprised.  This agitation
                      is mostly coming from the top.  The rest
                      of us are just interested in minding our
                      own business...we're peaceful enough.   
                          ( a beat)
                      They're not going to lock us all up.  

                                TRENT
                      And this doesn't bother you?

                                FEMALE RHEINLAND PILOT
                      It will pass.  None of us lives forever. 
                      Besides, people like them need us -- like
                      you and me. 

            Trent's drink arrives.

                                FEMALE RHEINLAND PILOT (CONT'D)
                          (to the bartender)
                      This on's on me.

            The Bartender understands.  Trent takes his drink, nods his
            thanks.

                                FEMALE RHEINLAND PILOT (CONT'D)
                          (toasting)
                      To the here and now.

            She smiles.  Trent raises his glass.

            A3RTC29RUMOR22 - ANY RHEINLAND TAVERN

            Trent finds a tipsy RHEINLAND SCIENTIST, HOCHSTEDLER,
            balding, on his fourth drink.

                                HOCHSTEDLER
                          (unsteady)
                      Ah..a Bretonian Pilot.

                                TRENT
                      Freelancer.

                                HOCHSTEDLER
                      Your Government has done well to stay out
                      of these matters with the treacherous
                      Kusari.  They steal you know.

            Off Trent's look.  The scientist nods and slams a drink.

                                HOCHSTEDLER (CONT'D)
                          (exhaling booze breath -
                           smooth)
                      Oh, Ja! They send agents all of the time
                      to meddle in our affairs, to try and
                      steal our superior technology.  It's no
                      secret.  One was caught here recently.  I
                      saw the body myself.

            Trent lets this wash over him.  He nods and looks around the
            room - hoping that the scientist will quiet down - maybe go
            away.

                                HOCHSTEDLER (CONT'D)
                          (leaning in)
                      I was even told that the plans for the
                      great big whatever it is that the Kaiser
                      has been working on have gone missing.

            ANGLE ON: Trent wincing. 

            ANGLE ON:  Trent and Hochstedler from across the room, framed
            the back of a Man's head and shoulders in the fg.  He exhales
            smoke away from us and puts a hand to his ear.  It's the same
            man who was following Trent earlier.  We still don't see his
            face.

                                HOCHSTEDLER (CONT'D)
                          (filter)
                      Can you imagine if our enemies got a hold
                      of those, Bretonian?  Those bastards. 
                      They won't get away.

            The figure listening in, takes another drag and -

            VERY CLOSE ANGLE ON:  Him crushing it out in the ashtray.

            MISSION 16 (PART 2)

            See Mission Pack.

            Note: When Trent eventually reaches Abe to find Von
            Claussen...

            A3RTC30 - INT. OLD TERRAFORMING PLATFORM ON ABE - LANDING
            DECK (PLAYS)

            The Terraforming Platform hovers high above the swirling seas
            of the planet Abe; the clearly weathered station stands in 
            stark contrast to the planet's fledgeling environment.  After
            Trent's ship lands, he gets out, faced with high winds and
            rain.  He holds his hands up to shield his face and looks
            around.  There sits a Rheinland fighter - maxed out.  

            Under a metal overhang stands a man warming his hands at a
            portable heater.  It casts a orange-ish glow to his face as
            he rubs his hands together.  Trent runs, escaping the rain to
            the man.  As he gets closer, Trent notices that MARKUS VON
            CLAUSSEN, forties, bald, and moustached is a vision of
            aristocratic finery - brocade coat, riding boots and all.

                                TRENT
                      You Von Claussen?

                                VON CLAUSSEN
                      Why don't you come warm yourself by the
                      fire, Mr. Trent?

                                TRENT
                      We're a little short on time -

            Von Claussen produces a small screen and attunes it.  It
            shows an image of Trent.  It is scanning him.

                                VON CLAUSSEN
                      Yes we are. 

            The screen flashes the green letters:  Human, no alien
            contamination.  Trent notices this.

                                TRENT
                      What are you doing there?

                                VON CLAUSSEN
                      Checking your references.  I'd hate to
                      end up like the rest.

                                TRENT
                      The rest?

                                VON CLAUSSEN
                      Ignorance is bliss, Mr. Trent.  The less
                      you know the better off you are.

                                TRENT
                      Fine.  It's not like I'm already risking
                      my life here.

                                VON CLAUSSEN
                      Surely no more than I. 

            Trent doesn't have a quip for him.

                                VON CLAUSSEN (CONT'D)
                      Shall we go?

            Von Claussen rubs his hands together one last time and
            brushes past Trent, making fir his ship.  Trent looks into
            the fire.  That went well.  He follows.

            MISSION 16 (PARTS 3 - 7)

            Note: High above Abe, two Rheinland fighters attack. They are
            on the run.

            After eliminating them, where Von Claussen proves that he can
            hold his own, they hide in a Nebula.

            Von Claussen talks about what he's found and asks if Trent is
            ready to get on with it.  Trent thought that it was just
            about smuggling out Von Claussen.  No, Von Claussen tells him
            that they cannot leave Rheinland until the secret weapons are
            destroyed.  He has made arrangements to hook up with two
            wings of Bundschuh pirates to do the job.  Didn't Akiro tell
            him.  No, says Trent.  Too late, he's committed.  Nobody on
            this mission expects to stick around - they are all in this
            together.  

            They meet up with the Pirates and find the facility in the
            camouflaged area of the asteroid field.  The SHIPYARD
            contains two large bluish looking ships, unlike anything any
            of them have seen before.  These are the Kaiser's secret
            weapons.

            They are eventually destroyed and so is the facility.  They
            ALL then press on to punch a hole in the stepped up defenses
            around the ways out of Rheinland, - and needing to take out a
            Defense Installation in the Hamburg system.

            After this, they all punch through the Jump gate patrols and
            into Kusari Space.

            On the other side, they are met by Kusari forces -- and any
            pursuing ships are wiped out by Kusari's waiting for them.

            They make their way to the large Battleship and land.

            A3RTC31 - INT. KUSARI BATTLESHIP - FLIGHT DECK

            The ships land.  Trent and Von Claussen walk to Akiro and his
            men.  They are followed by Von Claussen's conspirators.  The
            two sides come together.  Akiro and Von Claussen shake hands.

                                LORD AKIRO
                      My dear friend, I am so pleased you made
                      it safely.
                          (to them all)
                      Welcome to Kusari.  We are -- all of us -
                      in your debt.

                                VON CLAUSSEN
                      Your choice of Mr. Trent was a good one. 
                      I commend you.

            He looks at Trent - but does not say thank you.

                                VON CLAUSSEN (CONT'D)
                      Now, if you'll forgive me...there is much
                      to do. 

                                LORD AKIRO
                      Of course, we will see to your men.

            Von Claussen bows and stalks off with a few men.  The crowd
            breaks up, leaving Akiro and Trent.

                                LORD AKIRO (CONT'D)
                      Governor Tekagi has agreed to see us.

                                TRENT
                      Us?

                                LORD AKIRO
                      You surprise me. Mr. Trent.  Do you still
                      mistrust me?

                                TRENT
                          (re: The change in plans)
                      Me mistrust you?  --You should have told
                      me the real plan, Akiro.  You owed me
                      that.  Were you afraid that I'd back out.

                                LORD AKIRO
                      No.  I did not know at the time.  What I
                      did know was that we had our best agent
                      going after our most crucial informant. 
                      And that they would do what was
                      necessary.
                          ( a beat)
                      Surely, that was enough.

            Akiro leaves with his men.  Trent furrows his brow, he does
            not understand these people.

                      Is there a crack in the foundation of
                      Liberty?  Reports have filtered down that
                      several high ranking Admirals that had
                      previously voiced dissenting opinions to
                      the recent policies of President Jacobi
                      have apparently been detained.  Neither
                      offices of the President nor the
                      Secretary of the Liberty Navy were
                      available for comment, but reported that
                      matters were well in hand.  Others here
                      at home speculate that a major political
                      struggle may be at work.

            Trent finds two KUSARI ELITE GUARDS sitting at a table, deep
            in discussion.  He eavesdrops.

                                KUSARI ELITE GUARD #1
                      I hear that we rescued some sort of
                      traitor from Rheinland.

                                KUSARI GUARD #2
                      No one knows who he is - he is kept under
                      constant guard.  Special Guard. 

                                KUSARI ELITE GUARD #1
                      I'm not surprised.  I think Rheinland has
                      offered a huge bounty for his head and
                      that of his accomplice.

                      incomplete communication through normal
                      political channels have been cut off with
                      the President's Office.  Rumors of a
                      military coup have reached us as well as
                      the report that the President's Guards
                      were attacked and killed.  Her
                      whereabouts are unknown at this time -
                      but she is feared to be dead. 
                      Eyewitnesses say  that the military has
                      been mobilized in each system to maintain
                      order.  The Shogunate reacted with dismay
                      and concern but, tonight, waits along
                      with the rest of us for more news from
                      the troubled colony.

            Trent runs into a FEMALE KUSARI PILOT at a table.

                                FEMALE KUSARI PILOT
                      Listen, I did a job a few days ago in
                      Liberty.  If you know what's good for
                      you, you'll stay away from there - it
                      isn't safe.  The guy I flew with - gone. 
                      Our direct report - gone.  Finally, when
                      our cargo disappeared from the depot - I
                      jumped out of there as fast as I could
                      and didn't look back. 

            Note: Wherever Trent is, he hears the familiar beeping and  - 

                                                           FADE TO WHITE

            A3RTC34RUMOR25 - GIBSONIC SPACE

            From white, Trent appears to Akiro.

                                LORD AKIRO 
                      Mr. Trent, I am pleased to ask you to
                      meet me at the Imperial Palace in
                      Hokkaido.  Governor Tekagi will see us
                      now.

                                TRENT
                      It's about time.

                                LORD AKIRO
                      My friend, be careful, there are high
                      level rumors about Rheinland demanding
                      retribution for our delivering Von
                      Claussen. 
                      One of my number has disappeared -
                      presumably assassinated.  Take care -
                      they know you now. 

                                                           FADE TO WHITE

            Trent reappears whereever he was.

            When he arrives in Hokkaido at the Imperial Palace...

            A3RTC35A - INT. SHOGUN EDO'S IMPERIAL PALACE - MAIN HALL

            Trent enters the room, a huge assembly is in session in which
            Shogun Edo is addressing the delegates of the Shogunate and
            the crowd.  A Kusari Elite Guard stops him, but steps aside
            when Lord Akiro puts up his hand - he's with me.  As they
            walk through the crowd, the Shogun's voice booms.  

                                SHOGUN EDO
                      And now I am greatly saddened by the
                      troubles in the colony of Liberty.  Our
                      intelligence has no further information
                      to report on the fate of President
                      Jacobi, but we have uncovered a fragment
                      of data that may suggest  pro-Rheinland
                      sympathies running deep in their military
                      cabinet.  It is possible that our ally
                      may, if revolution follows its course,
                      may turn against us.  Even the work of
                      our heroic Governor Tekagi -

            He indicates Tekagi on the dais, who bows slowly.  Tekagi
            sees Trent and Akiro in the crowd.  He whispers to an aide
            and gets up as the Shogun continues.

                                SHOGUN EDO (CONT'D)
                      was not sufficient to secure a peaceful
                      settlement with out Rheinland
                      neighbors...

            Lord Akiro maneuvers Trent to the end of the crowd as the
            Shogun continues.

                                SHOGUN EDO (CONT'D)
                      Unfortunately, involving us in a bitter
                      struggle to maintain our identity and
                      peaceful existence.  But nevertheless, a
                      struggle that is every Kusarian's duty to
                      uphold if we are survive.

            They enter -

            A3RTC35B - INT. SHOGUN EDO'S IMPERIAL PALACE - BOARD ROOM

            The Board Room.  As the door opens and Trent and Lord Akiro
            enter, Trent notices the long table with multiple chairs
            around it, framed by the huge stained glass window at the
            head - depicting a calm, beautifully rendered Asian-style
            water setting.  They walk into the room...

                                TRENT
                      So that was Shogun Edo.  Descendant of
                      Edo Zanten?

                                LORD AKIRO
                      Yes, why?

                                GOVERNOR TEKAGI (O.S.)
                      I had no idea, Mr. Trent, that you had an
                      interest in our Leader's bloodline?

            They both turn suddenly and see GOVERNOR TEKAGI, trim, late
            fifties, bearded, grey, in his robes, closing the double
            doors behind his back.  Akiro bows.  Tekagi advances on them,
            smiling.

                                GOVERNOR TEKAGI (CONT'D)
                      I understand that you have done sterling
                      work for Akiro in helping us eliminate
                      the Black Dragons and the poisonous
                      Rheinland treachery.  He must have
                      instructed you well.

            He puts a hand on Akiro.  Trent bows.

                                TRENT
                      Yes, Governor.  My Lord Akiro has opened
                      my eyes to --many things.

                                GOVERNOR TEKAGI
                      Excellent, Mr. Trent.

            He extends his hand and in true English style...

                                GOVERNOR TEKAGI (CONT'D)
                      I am pleased to make you acquaintance.

            Trent looks at it - then takes it, as Akiro's head is still
            bowed.

                                TRENT
                      Thank you, sir.

            The Governor smiles - pleased with his continental self - and
            walks to his place at the head of the table, upon which a
            medium sized, ornate box rests in it's center.  He bids them
            to sit.  They do.  Akiro next to Trent.

                                GOVERNOR TEKAGI
                      Akiro here has shown me Dr. Quintaine's
                      research --very impressive.  You were
                      wise to contact me, I seriously doubt if
                      our paths would have crossed any other
                      way.  For that I am grateful.  

                                LORD AKIRO
                      We are grateful, Governor.

                                TRENT
                          (cutting to it)
                      So you've got it.  When can I have it?

            Akiro is surprised at his tone - he starts to protest.  

                                LORD AKIRO
                      Mr. Trent, there is a protocol to such -

            Tekagi holds up his hand.

                                GOVERNOR TEKAGI
                      Akiro, do not trouble yourself.  I
                      understand his impatience.  I, too, am
                      eager.  Very well.. There is your prize,
                      Mr. Trent.

            He indicates the box.  Trent pulls it towards him.  He looks
            up - may I open it?  Tekagi gestures - yes.  Akiro and Trent
            smile.  The box is the kind of thing that opens from the
            front on a heavy base --mostly for display.  He opens it and
            finds --

            Von Claussen's head on a base.

            Trent is freaked.

                                LORD AKIRO
                      Von Claussen!

                                GOVERNOR TEKAGI
                      That's right, dear friend.

            Tekagi extends his arm and a blade shoots out of it, impaling
            Akiro in his chair.

            ANGLE ON: Back of chair as the blade goes through.

            ANGLE ON: Akiro's lifeless hand falling to the table. 

            Trent springs up and runs to the door.  Locked.

            Governor Tekagi stands politely, calmly.

                                GOVERNOR TEKAGI (CONT'D)
                          (smiling)
                      I really am grateful, Mr. Trent.  How
                      else would I have been able to find the
                      Rheinland traitor, eliminate my good
                      friend Akiro and find the tome in one
                      swift move?  

            Tekagi reaches into his robes and pulls out a slender
            titanium tube - (holding a piece of rolled parchment) and
            smiles.

                                GOVERNOR TEKAGI (CONT'D)
                      This tome, in fact.  Now quite safe with
                      me.

            Trent takes a step towards him.

                                GOVERNOR TEKAGI (CONT'D)
                      Be sure, Mr. Trent.  Do you really know
                      what you are dealing with?

            With that he begins to change -- his eyes turn white and
            begin to glow.  He laughs.  A blade locks into place in his
            sleeve - he scowls, about to deliver the deathblow.

            Suddenly behind him the window shatters and a harpoon-like
            projectile pierces his back and come out his chest- CLICK -
            it's hook-like fins lock in front of his sternum.  His hands
            clutch at it.  Finally, he looks back to Trent - Tekagi's
            face is a mask of horror - eyes, white and bleeding, cracks
            forming from his orbs to his chin, scalp and hands, his chest
            wound - shafts of energy begin to jet out.  His shrieks are
            no longer human.   Trent is horrified.

                                GOVERNOR TEKAGI (CONT'D)
                          (barely human voice)
                      No!

            YANK!  CRRAAAASSHHH!!!  Tekagi is suddenly pulled out the
            ornate glass window like a fish and falls into the HUGE open
            air atrium.  He plummets at the end of a tether.  Trent runs
            to the hole and sees him fall towards the activity below
            until --- VOOOOM! Tekagi explodes.  A winch pulls the harpoon
            and cable back, it snakes past Trent's head.  Trent looks up
            and sees a ship above him.  It lowers down in front of him. 
            Engines screaming.  It's a ship Trent does not recognize -
            it's beautiful, black.  

            Suddenly, violent knocking at the door and the sound of
            people yelling.  Trent looks into the canopy across from him - 

            RAPID FIRE FLASHES AND JUMP CUTS: To THE MAN who calmly
            controls the ship with one hand and a smokes a cigarette with
            the other. WE'VE SEEN HIM BEFORE - It's the man who was
            following Trent in Rheinland.  He turns the ship sideways and
            opens the cargo door.  

                                ORILLION
                          (yelling over the PA)
                      Mr. Trent.  Jump.

            Trent stands in the windy gap.

                                TRENT
                      What?

                                ORILLION
                          (PA)
                      Jump.  It's the only way out.

                                TRENT
                      No way!

            SLO-MO: The door finally bursts open behind him and Guards
            come rushing in - guns a blazing.  He looks over his shoulder
            - oh, man.  He sees the gleaming cylinder (with the tome) on
            the table and makes a dive for it.  Guards start to shoot,
            barely missing him, but rolling the cylinder across the
            table.  He tries for it again and is met with a hail of
            energy that consumes the table and the wall.  He gets up - we
            don't know if he got it.  It looks like he thinks better of
            it and is forced to make a full out run - full speed - for
            the open window -- and jumps across the large gap.  He makes
            it --barely, grappling onto the side of the ship.  Guards
            shoot at him --the bolts, impacting the ship's shields
            harmlessly in front of Trent's body.  Orillion lifts off and
            flies up towards the top of the Palace, shattering the glass
            roof of the atrium as he goes out.  Guards continue to shoot,
            despite the raining glass.  

            A3RTC35C - EXT. HOKKAIDO LANDING PAD (PLAYS)

            Orillion's ship dips into frame.  Trent is barely hanging
            onto the side of the ship. 

                                ORILLION
                          (PA)
                      We've got to go.  There isn't much time.

                                TRENT
                      Who the hell are you?

                                ORILLION
                          (PA)
                      Does it matter?  They're coming!

            Trent looks to see in the distance: Elite Guards hit the
            deck, shooting. Orillion drops off Trent above his ship and
            he slides down the rest of the way onto the deck.  Surprised
            onlookers get out of his way.  Avoiding laser fire, Trent
            gets in his ship and guns it.  

            Orillion and he take off and make for the docking ring.

            MISSION 17

            See Mission Pack.

            Note: After avoiding being captured or destroyed, Trent is
            guided to the Epsilon-Chi system, where a large black ship -
            like the one from the open - decloaks.  Trent is amazed: A
            cloaking ship...Rheinland?  No, not quite - says Orillion. 

            They enter the ship and it recloaks.

            A3RTC36A - INT. OSIRIS LANDING DECK

            Trent's ship lands next to Orillion's.  As Trent emerges,
            CASPER ORILLION, 45, strong, stubble a cigarette dangling
            from his mouth, walks towards him smiling - if he were French
            he'd be Jean Reno - same build, looks and charm.  Looks like
            he's been to hell and back. 

            ANGLE ON: ORILLION'S BACK as he heads towards Trent's open
            ship.

            Trent looks around on the unfamiliar deck until he sees
            Orillion.

            As Orillion approaches -

                                ORILLION
                      Welcome to the Osiris, Mr. Trent.

            His welcome is met with a right hook that sends him to the
            deck.

            SHOUTS.  Several SOLDIERS, dressed in distinctive uniforms,
            grab Trent and one man cocks his weapon - putting it in his
            face.  He is about to squeeze the trigger.

                                ORILLION (O.S.) (CONT'D)
                      Stand down!

            ANGLE ON: Orillion on the deck.  Rubbing his chin.

                                ORILLION (CONT'D)
                      Do it!

            The surprised Lieutenants let Trent go, with stern looks. 
            Trent's eyes are glued on Orillion, who is helped up by
            someone we do not see.

                                ORILLION (CONT'D)
                      That's an interesting was to say thank
                      you, Mr. Trent. 

                                TRENT
                          (hard)
                      Thanks.

            ANGLE ON: Orillion. The camera widens and pans to the man who
            helped him up --It's NORRINGTON, in uniform. 

                                TRENT (CONT'D)
                      Wait.  I know you.

                                NORRINGTON
                      Yes, Trent...from the dig site.

                                TRENT
                          (re: Norrington)
                      You were Dr. Sinclair's assistant.

                                SINCLAIR (O.S.)
                      He still is, Mr. Trent.

            He turns to see Dr. Sinclair and Dr. Quintaine standing
            behind him.

                                SINCLAIR (CONT'D)
                      I'm glad to see that you're in one piece.
                          (she smiles)
                      I'm sure Jun'ko will be happy to see you.

                                TRENT
                      She's here?

                                SINCLAIR
                      Well...yes.  She's on a mission right
                      now.  Didn't you know?

            She glances at Orillion - who starts to answer.  This is all
            hitting Trent pretty hard.

                                TRENT
                          (cutting Orillion off before he
                           starts)
                      Whoa, wait.  What is going on here?

                                SINCLAIR
                          (to Orillion)
                      You didn't tell him?

            Orillion's eyes shift to Sinclair.

                                QUINTAINE
                      Where is Akiro?

            Then to Quintaine.

                                ORILLION
                      We were too late.

                                TRENT
                      Hey?!

                                QUINTAINE
                          (a bit sad)
                      I see.  
                          (then - with concern)
                      And the missing tome?

                                TRENT
                          (to anyone)
                      Hello?

                                ORILLION
                      Lost, I am afraid, but we can -

                                QUINTAINE
                          (agitated)
                      But nothing.  Without that I can't finish
                      the translation.  And if I don't finish
                      the translation, I -

            A BLARING WHISTLE.  They all look at Trent.  He takes his
            fingers out of his mouth.  They see that he is holding up a
            titanium cylinder - The Tome.  He got it after all.  They
            look surprised.

                                TRENT
                      Now would someone like to tell me what
                      the hell is going on around here?

                                ORILLION
                      I will, Mr. Trent.  

                                TRENT
                      Fine.  You can start with your name.

                                ORILLION
                      My name is Casper Orillion.

                                TRENT
                      Orill -?  The Orillion?  So these men are
                      with the...

            Realizing.

                                ORILLION
                      The Order, Mr. Trent.  Yes.

            Trent turns to Sinclair and Quintaine.

                                TRENT
                          (re: them)
                      And?

            They both nod.  Trent looks back at Orillion.  He's pale.

                                ORILLION
                      I know what you need, Mr. Trent.

                                                                 CUT TO:

            A3RTC36B - INT. OSIRIS LOUNGE - LATER

            ANGLE ON: Drink being poured.

                                TRENT
                      So what you're saying is that Tekagi
                      wasn't - you know?  I feel crazy saying
                      it.

            ANGLE ON: Orillion pouring.

                                ORILLION
                          (Matter-of-factly)
                      Wasn't Human?  No.  Hadn't been for some
                      time, not since his meeting with the
                      Kaiser, we think.  He's the point of
                      infection we've been looking for. 

            Dr.'s Sinclair and Quintaine sit with Trent and Norrington as
            Orillion stands.

                                TRENT
                      The Kaiser has some sort of disease?

                                NORRINGTON
                      He is the disease.

                                ORILLION
                      It appears Rheinland found more than they
                      thought when they dug into the Daam
                      K'Vosh planetoid.  

                                TRENT
                      Artifacts?

                                ORILLION
                      Oh, yes.  But they also attracted the
                      attention of another race that had
                      remained hidden since we arrived.  

            Trent is surprised.

                                ORILLION (CONT'D)
                      Yes, our first contact with another
                      sentient species.  But not friendly, I'm
                      afraid.

                                SINCLAIR
                      You see, Trent, and this may seem hard to
                      grasp, they look at us as invaders.  On
                      territory that they have inhabited since
                      the Daam-K'Vosh became extinct.

                                TRENT
                      Wait a second.  How do you know all this?

                                ORILLION
                      We've been successful in interrogating a
                      few of the human hosts that the Nomads -
                      that's what we call them - had
                      contaminated.

                                TRENT
                      Like Tekagi?

                                ORILLION
                      Yes.
                          (a beat)
                      Our main goal has been to try and contain
                      them, extracting or eliminating where we
                      could.  But we haven't been able to reach
                      the Kaiser.

                                TRENT
                      You'd kill the Kaiser?

            The silence answers his question.

                                TRENT (CONT'D)
                      So all of those disappearances.  You're
                      telling me that those people were aliens?

                                ORILLION
                      Some.  Others -

                                WALKER (O.S.)
                      Others just came along for the ride.

            Trent turns to see Walker.  He stands.

                                ORILLION
                      Mr. Walker, let me introduce -

                                TRENT
                      We've met.

                                ORILLION
                      Really?

                                WALKER
                      Yes, sir.  Trent and I "worked" together
                      once.  An experience I didn't expect
                      merited repeating. 

                                TRENT
                      Likewise.  Sorry to hear you're not dead,
                      Walker. But then again - 

            At this point Jun'ko Crane enters the room --and freezes,
            happy at first, then realizing that these two are at each
            other's throats.  She fumes, leaves the room.  Everyone is
            frozen - they get it. 

                                WALKER
                          (to Trent)
                      Well, Trent I see you have the same
                      magnetic repulsion to the opposite sex
                      that you always have.

            Trent runs after her (and doesn't find her).

            A3RTC37RUMOR26 - INT. OSIRIS LOUNGE

            Trent finds his old friend King, sitting in the corner.

                                KING
                      I heard you made it over, Trent.

            They shake hands like old comrades.  King sits.

                                KING (CONT'D)
                      Also heard you ran into Walker.

            Trent also sits.

                                TRENT
                      You heard that?  Word travels fast.

                                KING
                      Oh, yeah.  Can't keep a secret in the
                      clandestine world of galactic terrorism.

            He plays up that last bit - making fun of it.

            Then seriously.

                                KING (CONT'D)
                      Juni told me.

                                TRENT
                      Was she mad?

                                KING
                      Volcanic.

                                TRENT
                      It's just when I think of those two.

            Trent grimaces.

                                KING
                      What?  What did that effete snob tell
                      you?

                                TRENT
                      He made it clear that he and Juni - that
                      he --

            King starts to laugh.

                                KING
                      He wishes.

                                TRENT
                      What?  You mean?

                                KING
                      That's right.  You've been played, my
                      man.

            It dawns on Trent.  He groans.

                                KING (CONT'D)
                      Yep.  You've got ass pain coming with
                      Juni, but --and you didn't hear this from
                      me - she's glad you're here.

                                TRENT
                      She is?

            King holds his finger over his lips.  Shhh.

            A3RTC38RUMOR27 - INT. OSIRIS - LANDING DECK

            Trent finally finds Juni on the landing deck, she hammers out
            a piece of sheet metal on the deck, with a large hammer.  

            Clang! Clang! Clang!  Trent walks up to Juni.  She doesn't
            say a word.  The Clang makes him reflexively blink, it's so
            loud.

                                TRENT
                      Hi.

            Clang!

                                TRENT (CONT'D)
                      Juni, I -

            Clang!

                                TRENT (CONT'D)
                      I -

            Clang!

            The clangs keep drowning him out.

                                TRENT (CONT'D)
                      Look, I'd - 

            Clang!  He summons up what he wants to say - quickly.

                                TRENT (CONT'D)
                          (very fast and very loud)
                      I didn't know that you and Walker weren't
                      serious.  I was jealous and I just wanted
                      to say, I'm sorry!

            He closes his eyes - expecting a clang!  It doesn't come.  He
            opens his eyes and sees her standing there, hammer on hip.

                                JUNI
                      You what?

                                TRENT
                      Which part?

                                JUNI
                      All of it.

            Trent starts to regroup.

                                JUNI (CONT'D)
                      Never mind.

            She embraces him and kisses him.

            In between breaths -

                                TRENT
                      I -

                                JUNI
                      Shut up, Trent.

            They go back to kissing.  Pretty hot.

            People around the deck react.

                                                            DISSOLVE TO:

            A3RTC39RUMOR28 - INT. OSIRIS - LOUNGE (PLAYS) - LATER

            In the lounge, she and Trent sit.

                                JUNI
                      And then after things got too hot for us
                      to hide anymore, The Order paid us a
                      visit, thanks to Dr. Quintaine.  He was
                      working with them all along.

                                TRENT
                      Why didn't they stop us from finding him?

                                JUNI
                      They wanted us to find him.  It was the
                      only way to put the pieces of the puzzle
                      together.  They made it easy.

                                TRENT
                      It was not easy.

                                JUNI
                      And then we met Orillion.

                                TRENT
                      Do you believe the alien take over crap?

                                JUNI
                      I suppose you don't?

                                TRENT
                      I wouldn't have before Tekagi, but
                      now...What about the artifact?  What is
                      it?

                                JUNI
                      No one knows.  Not even Orillion.  Trent,
                      they've found evidence of infiltration
                      high up in the Liberty chain of Command. 
                      That's why they were hunted.  The Nomads
                      knew that Orillion was on to something.   

                                TRENT
                      So what now?

                                JUNI
                      I don't know.  Orillion says that the
                      Nomads wanted to start this war to soften
                      us up.  I guess to invade.  The only safe
                      place for us right now is pretty far out.

                                TRENT
                      How far?

                                JUNI
                      Santiago.

                                TRENT
                      Great, I'm back in the Border worlds.

            ACT FOUR

            A4RTC1 - OSIRIS LANDING DECK

            Trent is reequipping his ship with Juni and King, when
            Orillion comes walking up.

                                ORILLION (O.S.)
                      Jun'ko Crane!

            This gets Juni's attention.  She turns.

                                JUNI
                      Sir!

            Orillion comes in with a AN ESCORT.

                                ORILLION
                      We've just gotten word that President
                      Jacobi is alive.

            They are astonished.

                                ORILLION (CONT'D)
                      Several of our operatives, following a
                      Nomad Host ship have reported that she's
                      being held in the Alaska system.

                                TRENT
                      Alaska?

                                KING
                      It's a small military star system -- off
                      limits.  Liberty uses it to test
                      prototype ships.

                                ORILLION
                      Well now, the Nomads have it.  

                                JUNI
                      What's the President's status?

                                ORILLION
                      Unknown.  I want you to take a detachment
                      and find out.  Rescue or terminate.  Do
                      you understand?

                                JUNI
                      Yes, Sir.

                                ORILLION
                      Good.  You are to hook up with our
                      operatives in the field.  Take Walker.

            Trent stiffens.  Orillion zeroes in on Trent.

                                ORILLION (CONT'D)
                      Mr. Trent, I'd try and talk you out of
                      going, but from what I understand about
                      you, I'd be wasting my breath.

            Trent says nothing.

                                ORILLION (CONT'D)
                      So I'm going to ask you to do everything
                      you can to help Col. Crane.  Understood? 
                      That means no heroics.  No grudges.  You
                      will work as a team.  Got it?

            He nods.

                                ORILLION (CONT'D)
                      Leave at once.  Good luck.

            Orillion leaves.  Trent turns to Juni.

                                TRENT
                          (re: her title)
                      Colonel?

            She shrugs.

            MISSION 18 (PARTS 1 - 4)

            See Mission Pack.

            Note: Trent, King, Juni and Walker go, hook up with the
            operatives, zigzag into Zone 21 and into Alaska.  There they 
            find a prison dank platform.  King and a few ships stay out
            and keep watch.  The others sneak in.

            A4RTC2A - INT. CELL - PRISON PLATFORM

            Drip..Drip..Drip.  It's very dark in the cell.  A figure is
            strapped to a vertical metal table.  Her head turns slightly
            and she groans softly.  She's been drugged and her shoulder
            has been wounded.  This is PRESIDENT JACOBI, 40, obviously
            not at her best.  The sound of the dripping has awakened her. 
            Her eyes open slowly and then she realizes that she is bound -
            she struggles.  At that moment, CLANG CLANG!!, the large
            metal door across from her opens  and several people come in.

            One by one, TWO LIBERTY MILITARY OFFICERS AND AN OFFICIAL
            enter and take their positions.  One of them, SECRETARY REED,
            late forties - gruff, approaches her.  

                                REED
                      Madame President, I'm glad to see you're
                      awake.

            Her vision is blurry, but she makes him out.

                                JACOBI
                          (slowly)
                      Reed.  What's the meaning of this? - OW!

            A shooting pain comes from her shoulder.

                                REED
                      I'm sorry about your shoulder, we tried
                      to dress it as well as possible.  He
                      requested that you be taken unharmed. 
                      Well, that was not possible.

            A4RTC2B - INT. LANDING DECK - PRISON PLATFORM

            The ships land on the apparently empty deck.  Juni, Trent,
            Walker and several other soldiers look around, weapons drawn.
            Juni, with another large weapon strapped to her back, fans
            them out. 

            Walker walks past a bunch of crates.  He examines the
            contents - GRAVATIC MINES.  Hmmm.  He moves on.

                                TRENT
                          (to Juni)
                      Hey, where to?

            Juni looks over and sees a computer.  

                                JUNI
                      Let's find out.

            A4RTC2C - INT. CELL - PRISON PLATFORM

                                JACOBI
                      Who?  Reed, you traitorous son-of-a
                      bitch, who requested? 

            Reed walks over to the door and opens it.  Jacobi is too
            pissed to be scared.  In walks KAISER FLORIAN GUSTOV
            SCHEMENT, fifties. 

                                JACOBI (CONT'D)
                      The Kaiser...

            The Kaiser smiles.

                                SCHEMENT
                      I'm glad to see these fools didn't damage
                      you too badly, my dear.

            He walks past Reed who bows his head like a dog.  She sees
            that he obviously has Reed in his pocket.

                                SCHEMENT (CONT'D)
                      But time is short, I wanted these few
                      minutes to plant a seed, as it were.

            He smiles at his own humor.  She struggles more.

                                JACOBI
                      Goddammit, Schement, I will not rest
                      until I see you pay for this.

            He continues to walk to her until he is looking right up at
            her face.  She spits.  Schement wipes it off and smiles up at
            her.

                                SCHEMENT
                      I understand your anger, Madame
                      President, I was misdirected at first,
                      too.  But then, I had my mind opened to
                      other possibilities --as you will.

            He reaches out and places both hands on each side of her
            head.  SLAP!  - forcing her mouth open.  His eyes roll back
            and he opens his --except his mouth opens wider -- much --
            much wider and a LONG PROBOSCIS OF SOMETHING HORRIBLE BEGINS
            TO WRIGGLE OUT.

            CLOSE ON: Her eyes.  She screams.

            Reed fidgets and the two Officers smile reverently.  Then a
            sharp WHINE is HEARD.  They look around.  What is that, it's
            coming from behind them.  From the -- they look - 

            BLAMMO!  The door explodes inward from the explosive charge,
            killing Reed and the two men.

            Trent and Juni run through the GAPING HOLE over the big
            flames and debris.  They see the Kaiser trying to liplock the
            President -

                                TRENT
                      Jesus, is that the Kaiser?

            He hesitates.  The Kaiser turns - the big slug-like thing
            still sticking out of his mouth. 

                                JUNI
                      Just shoot!

            They open fire - BLOWING THE KAISER UP AGAINST THE WALL with
            tremendous force beams, until he slumps to the floor.

            Juni runs to the President and works to release her.  Trent
            checks the Kaiser's body with his boot.

                                JACOBI
                          (to Trent - pissed as hell)
                      What the hell did you want an engraved
                      invitation?

                                TRENT
                      Unlike some people, I'm not in the habit
                      of killing political figures, alright?

                                JUNI
                      Trent, did he look like a human being to
                      you?

                                TRENT
                      Look -

            As he turns around, the Kaiser's body BURSTS OPEN and
            something ugly, huge and larval looking jumps out, towering
            over Trent.  It's tentacles reaches to consume him.  Before
            he can react though - BLAM BLAM BLAM BLAM BLAM

            Trent is narrowly missed by HUGE plasma fire.  The "thing"
            ROARS and is engulfed.  It falls to the floor, burning and
            oozing, twitching parts on fire. SOUND of snapping and
            popping.  Trent looks back to see - Juni and the President,
            now holding a huge weapon - (the one from Juni's back),
            standing back to back, guns smoking, out of breath from the
            fire fight.  Anger burns in the President's eyes.   Trent
            looks sheepish and a little singed.  There is nothing to say.

            MISSION 18 (PARTS 5 AND 6)

            Note: The ships launch from the deck and get away easily. 
            She was mean to be found - but after her conversion - now
            that - that plan has been foiled, here come the troops.

            They loose some of their people and are about to get swarmed
            when Walker tells Trent that he has a whole load of Gravatic
            Mines on his ship --he's going to take out the ships.  Trent
            tries to stop him, but he tells Trent to take care of Juni. 
            Juni yells for Walker.

            He blows up taking a bunch of enemy ships with him.

            On the last leg, they are about to be swarmed again when the
            Osiris decloaks just in time.  They board her and she
            disappears just as the enemy ships arrive -- and lose her.

            A4RTC3 - INT. OSIRIS LANDING DECK 

            They begin to get out of their ships as Orillion and a few
            others come to the deck.  They walk up to Juni.

                                ORILLION
                      Sit rep., Colonel.

                                JUNI
                      Sir, we have Jacobi.  The Kaiser is dead,
                      several of his Liberty Hosts are dead. 
                      We have some weapons and raided their
                      tactical files.

            She holds up a datachip.

                                ORILLION
                          (to an Aide)
                      Have it analyzed.

            The AIDE takes the chip and leaves.  Juni is uneasy ..she
            left something out.

                                JUNI
                      We also lost some, Sir...  
                          (a beat)
                      including Walker.

            This sinks into Orillion, he exhales loudly.

                                JUNI (CONT'D)
                          (haltingly)
                      He sacrificed himself to buy us time.

                                ORILLION
                      I take it then the President is
                      unharmed..

                                JACOBI (O.S.)
                      Not exactly unharmed. 

            She limps in, rubbing her shoulder, with Trent and King
            assisting.

                                JACOBI (CONT'D)
                      But still me, if that's what you mean.

            Orillion shoots a glance at Juni, who nods her affirmation. 
            Then back to the Jacobi.

                                JACOBI (CONT'D)
                      Judging how everybody is acting, I assume
                      you are the go to man around here.  Who
                      do I owe my thanks to?

                                JUNI
                      President Jacobi, please meet Casper
                      Orillion.

            She is surprised and then not.

                                JACOBI
                      So you're Orillion.

            He nods.  She walks up to him, studying his face.  Finally.

                                JACOBI (CONT'D)
                      Thank you, Mr. Orillion.

            She extends her hand. He looks at it and then takes it.

                                ORILLION
                      Madame President...these are the people
                      you should be thanking.

            He indicates them.

            Another AIDE steps in.

                                AIDE
                      Sir, we've cleared the badlands. Your
                      orders?

                                ORILLION
                      Yes, set course for Santiago.  Send a
                      message to Quintaine that we may have
                      more information for him...

            Orillion looks at the President and all.

                                ORILLION (CONT'D)
                      ...and tell him that we've got an
                      Official Guest for him to meet.

            Orillion smiles.

            A4RTC4RUMOR1 - INT. OSIRIS LOUNGE

            Trent finds Juni sitting alone in the lounge.  He walks up
            and sits across from her.  Juni looks a little overrun.

                                TRENT
                      How are you doing?

                                JUNI
                      Jacobi's resting in medical, Orillion's
                      trying to work out our next move and King
                      is doing..whatever King does.

                                TRENT
                      No.  How are you doing?

                                JUNI
                      Hmmm.  
                          (thinks about it - digs deep)
                      You know how when we were back on the
                      planetoid looking for Sinclair...

                                TRENT
                      Yeah.

                                JUNI
                      Couldn't go forward..couldn't go back... 
                      Scared shitless whistling in the dark?
                          (a beat)
                      That about sums it up.  

                                TRENT
                      Juni -

                                JUNI
                      We're at war Trent.  Do you understand
                      what that means.  And we're wanted by all
                      sides.  Doesn't that frighten you?

                                TRENT
                      Yes..yes it does.  

            He gets up and sits next to her in the booth.

                                TRENT (CONT'D)
                      But I know I'm not alone.

                                JUNI
                      I've - .  I guess Being relentless has a
                      way of crushing your social life.  I just
                      wanted to be the best.

                                TRENT
                      You are.

            This gets her attention.  A moment.

                                JUNI
                          (gently)
                      That must have hurt.

            Trent swallows, smiles.

                                TRENT
                      You have no idea.

            She gently rests her head on his shoulder.  She continues to
            look off - but not alone.

            A4RTC5RUMOR2 - INT. OSIRIS LANDING DECK 

            Trent finds the President and Orillion overlooking the
            Landing Deck.  They are leaning over a railing at the work
            below.  They turn when he comes over.  The President looks
            almost sad.

                                TRENT
                          (surprised)
                      Oh, I'm sorry --.

                                JACOBI
                      No.  Stay, Mr. Trent.  I never properly
                      thanked you for what you did.  Mr.
                      Orillion has been filling me in on the
                      Nomad's progress in the Colonies. 

                                ORILLION
                          (to Trent)
                      The information your team brought back
                      has showed a clear spread of the
                      contamination.  All of the colonies have
                      now been affected.  If not the leaders,
                      then key military units in the field and
                      they're getting stronger.  Communication
                      is breaking down..This will degenerate
                      into all out genocide with the Nomads
                      coming in to easily wipe out what's
                      left.. 
                          ( a beat)
                      We need...

            Orillion hesitates.

                                TRENT
                      What?

                                JACOBI
                      What no man can provide us, Mr. Trent. 
                      We need a miracle.

            A4RTC6RUMOR3 - INT. OSIRIS LOUNGE 

            Trent finds a LAB TECH, 20's, Bretonian,  in the lounge.

                                LAB TECH
                      You're that Trent fella, aren't you?
                          (a beat)
                      That's the artifact you found that the
                      Doctors are working on, isn't it? 

            Man, the artifact.  That seems like so long ago to Trent.  It
            shows on his face.

                                TRENT
                      Yes, I suppose it is.

                                LAB TECH
                      It's a puzzler, it is.

                                TRENT
                      You could say that. Are they any closer
                      to figuring out what it does?

                                LAB TECH
                      Dr. Quintaine has been holed up for days
                      trying to decipher his precious texts. 
                      Right now he thinks it could be a weapon. 
                      Dr. Sinclair isn't so sure.  We're still
                      feeding them information.  I'm sure
                      they'll tell us more when we get there. 
                      Don't worry. 

            A4RTC7A - INT. OSIRIS LOUNGE 

            Trent walks up to King in the lounge.

                                KING
                      So here we are, my friend.  I remember
                      when you were fresh off the banana boat
                      and still worried about fitting in, in
                      Liberty.
                          (a beat)
                      Seems like an age ago, doesn't it?

                                TRENT
                      It's not the time, it's the sides that
                      keep changing.

                                KING
                      Yeah..I don't know about you but I just
                      want to sit right here and make the world
                      come to me for a change.

            King thinks about this.  Juni rushes in.

                                JUNI
                          (to them both)
                      Orillion wants us.

            Trent looks at King.

                                TRENT
                          (Sotto - to King)
                      You know, you're to blame for this.

            King looks at him.  Me?

            Off Juni's look, they both get up, fast.

            A4RTC7B - INT. OSIRIS FLIGHT DECK

            King, Trent and Juni and a few others step onto the deck
            where Orillion and Jacobi are standing with a group of Lab
            Techs surrounding a Monitor, a conversation is in progress. 
            As they step in, the crowd parts allowing the CAMERA to get a
            better look, too ---- The Monitor is staticy and rough in
            it's transmission, though Quintaine's face can clearly be
            seen.  We are in the inner circle.

                                ORILLION
                          (to the monitor)
                      Wait, we lost you, Quintaine, say again.
                          (to a Lab Tech)
                      Can't you boost the signal?

                                LAB TECH #2
                      It's at max, sir.  We're still getting
                      interference.

            Quintaine's image shifts and dances.

                                QUINTAINE
                          (filter - choppy)
                      --A Nomad power station in Omicron
                      Minor... We need you to extract a power
                      cell from...in order to activate the
                      artifact...Hello, Orillion.. Are you
                      there? --We're sending our data to you
                      now...

            Then it's gone.

                                ORILLION
                          (Sotto - to himself)
                      A Nomad power station.  How the hell does
                      he expect us to do this?

            Jacobi looks at him.

                                JACOBI
                          (sotto - to him)
                      It doesn't seem like we have much choice
                      in the matter.

            Orillion knows.

            MISSION 19 (PARTS 1 - 4)

            See Mission Pack.

            Note: A small strike team.  The Mission outline will describe
            the action.  Comms are sent referring to the ENERGY
            DETECTOR'S in the ships and Orillion's plan.

            They find the huge organic structure, it's traps and
            defenses.  They get the power cell, but almost all of the
            others are killed - except for Juni, King and Trent.  They
            barely get back aboard the Osiris.

                                              SLOW LAP DISSOLVES THROUGH:

            A4RTC8 - MONTAGE - EXT. SPACE 

            Music plays.  The Osiris flies through amazing vistas of
            beauty.  The Osiris puts into the ORDER'S SECRET BASE, a huge
            complex with two bays for ships - one vacant.

            A4RTC9A - INT. ORDER'S SECRET BASE - RECEPTION AND CARGO DECK 

            Orillion, Trent, Juni, the President, King and others walk
            along the deck, past numerous weapon and food containers. 
            They are talking. 

                                JACOBI
                      This is very impressive, Mr. Orillion.  

            A4RTC9B - ORDER'S SECRET BASE - HALLWAY A

            The SOUND of huffing and puffing in the empty hallway.  Then,
            we hear running.  Finally, we see Quintaine - actually
            running.  He's out of breath.

            A4RTC9C - ORDER'S SECRET BASE - HALLWAY B

            He runs past various techs and soldiers.  They turn to see
            him go.

            ANGLE ON: His feet.

            ANGLE ON:  His beet red cheeks.

            He keeps running this way, then - that.  

            Finally  -

            A4RTC9D  - ORDER'S SECRET BASE - GALLERY OVERLOOKING
            RECEPTION AND CARGO DECK

            Orillion and the party, still walking slowly, are small in
            frame as Quintaine runs past the railed area in fg.  He's out
            of frame.  His running stops and he slowly steps back into
            frame, having noticed them.  

            ANGLE ON: Quintaine's POV of them walking below him far off.

            ANGLE ON: Quintaine - out of breath.  He wants to yell, but
            only hacks.  Wheezing away.  He is holding papers, bunched up
            in his hand.  He tries to yell again.  WHEEZE - COUGH. 

            Finally -

                                QUINTAINE
                          (yelling)
                      W...WE -- WE'VE FOUND IT!!!

            ANGLE ON: The group looking up.  What?

            ANGLE ON: Their POV of Quintaine - a dot jumping around. 
            Voice far off.

                                QUINTAINE (CONT'D)
                          (far off)
                      HEY!!!  We've found it.

            A small green square bleeds in where he is standing, then
            goes away.  Then it comes back, then it's gone.  Slowly at
            first, then faster until -

                                                            DISSOLVE TO:

            A4RTC10 - ORDER'S SECRET BASE - ARTIFACT LAB 

            The GREEN CURSOR of the screen replaces Quintaine and the
            flat panel, replaces the side of the deck.  Formulaic symbols
            begin to form behind the cursor as it now moves from left to
            right. 

                                SINCLAIR (O.S.)
                      As you know, Dr. Quintaine and I have
                      poured through the stolen data and have
                      come up with some new findings since we
                      found the last panel.

            ANGLE ON: THE LAB.  The PANELS are arranged around the lab
            table and equipment.  Trent, Orillion, Juni, the President
            are in front of them.  Sinclair is driving with Quintaine
            nearby.

                                SINCLAIR (CONT'D)
                      That panel.  It was the key.

            She indicates the panel behind Trent.

            ANGLE ON: Trent looking up and back at the panel behind him
            then back.

                                QUINTAINE
                      It seems the Daam-K'Vosh had a vast
                      empire.

                                ORILLION
                      How vast?

                                QUINTAINE
                      This entire expanse of the colonies in
                      Sirius, represents the tiniest part of
                      the whole --and not anywhere near what
                      must have been their capitol.  It may
                      have even reaches as far as SOL.
                          (a beat) )
                      But then for one reason or another,
                      seemingly overnight, they disappeared.  

                                TRENT
                      Disappeared.  I keep hearing disappeared. 
                      What does disappeared mean?

                                QUINTAINE
                      Gone, Mr. Trent.  There is no evidence to
                      suggest any kind of war or disease or
                      natural disaster that may have done away
                      with them.  They're just gone.  Which
                      leaves the Nomads.

                                ORILLION
                      Yes, the Nomads.  Is this artifact a
                      weapon we can use against them?

            Quintaine hesitates.

                                QUINTAINE
                      Not exactly.  

                                ORILLION
                      Then what good is it then?  

                                SINCLAIR
                      First the Nomads, or whatever they were
                      really called - we can't pronounce the
                      name yet.  They were apparently created
                      by the Daam-K'Vosh to --well - look after
                      things.

                                TRENT
                      We're fighting the goddamn caretakers?

                                JUNI/ORILLION/JACOBI
                      Shhhh!!

            Sinclair and Quintaine exchange glances.  She continues.

                                SINCLAIR
                      Well, in a manner of speaking.  They are
                      opportunistic parasites.  Not only of
                      animals but of technology.  They adapted
                      what the Daam-K'Vosh had built to suit
                      their own purposes.  Adapted their power
                      and moved into their structures.  They
                      have dammed up the resources and are
                      draining them to live on.

                                QUINTAINE
                      Which brings us to the artifact.  The
                      Daam-K'Vosh had an amazingly advanced
                      technology that was only partially based
                      in these delicate formations.  They used
                      them for power, shields..er.. this one is
                      a..well.. we'll show you.  Doctor
                      Sinclair?

            He looks at Sinclair who begins to load a program.

                                SINCLAIR
                          (progressively more excited)
                      I took the results of Dr. Quintaine's
                      research and discovered that if the
                      computer sounded out the phonetic
                      representation of the glyphs it had a
                      direct affect on the substrate of the
                      artifact, creating a charge.  Now that we
                      have the power cell, which is tied to -   

                                JACOBI
                      Please, Doctor, in deference to those of
                      us that are simple politicians...

            She looks up.  They are all lost.  Sinclair smiles, a little
            embarrassed.  This is her element.  

                                SINCLAIR
                          (sheepishly)
                      Very well.

            Her finger hovers over a blinking box on the screen - "GO". 
            She presses it.

            Immediately the computer begins to sound out the texts on
            each of the tomes, as it does the panel it is reading is lit.
            The sound is like a very complicated series of sounds that
            have a low frequency like TIBETAN MONKS CHANTING.  

            The group looks at each panel as it is lit.  Sinclair makes
            some adjustments and it goes faster..and faster..and faster -
            at a rate that only a computer could replicate.  The room
            light is much lower allowing the crazy flashing to illuminate
            the faces of the group, who are amazed. 

            ANGLE ON: The artifact.  It is starting to glow and vibrate a
            bit.

            ANGLE ON: Trent's eyes on it - transfixed.

            Finally, the SEQUENCE reaches a fever pitch and the ARTIFACT
            EXPLODES WITH COLOR AND RADIANCE as -

            WHAT CAN ONLY BE DESCRIBED AS A KIND OF MAP, with vectors
            traveling off in various holographic directions that would
            extend well beyond the room, arc and bend this way and that.

                                ORILLION
                      I'll be damned.

                                JACOBI
                      It's beautiful.

            Trent looks at a dot in front of his vision, blinking softly. 
            He points.

                                TRENT
                      What's that?

                                SINCLAIR
                      That would be us, Mr. Trent.  

            She lets this set in.

                                SINCLAIR (CONT'D)
                      The artifact knows where it is in space
                      at all times with respect to everything
                      else. A sort of "you are here", symbol.

            Trent looks up at her.

                                SINCLAIR (CONT'D)
                      This is a map.

                                JUNI
                      Yes, but of what, Doctor?

            Sinclair looks at Quintaine.  She swallows.

                                SINCLAIR
                      It's just a theory.

                                ORILLION
                      Spit it out.

            Quintaine interjects.

                                QUINTAINE
                      With an empire as large as the Daam
                      K'Vosh's they couldn't rely on simple
                      jump gates like we have today, they had
                      to develop something more sophisticated -
                      a vast array of hypergates, linking the
                      far corners of their empire via one
                      incredibly fast system for travel.
                          ( a beat)
                      This device is not only the map, it's the
                      trigger..the key to reawakening this
                      system.

            They all look at him dumbfounded.  Finally...

                                ORILLION
                      Are you suggesting turning this thing on?

                                QUINTAINE
                      I am .  If we can reactivate the
                      hypergates, we'll break the hold of the
                      Nomads on their power supply and cut them
                      down to a more manageable size....in
                      theory.

                                ORILLION
                      Every key has a lock, Doctor..where do we
                      find this one?

            Quintaine moves though the beams, that break as he passes. 
            He walks in front of the President and finds a light bundle. 
            He points. 

            CLOSE ANGLE ON:  The Bundle.

                                QUINTAINE
                      There.

            Slow push in to the bundle.

            A BLAST is heard suddenly, breaking the atmosphere.  Rumble. 
            The Camera shakes.  ALARMS!

            Orillion jumps up and hits a button on his wrist.

                                ORILLION
                          (to his wrist)
                      What's going on?

                                AIDE
                          (filter)
                      Nomads, sir.  They're attacking the city.
                      We're firing countermeasures, but they're
                      getting through.

                                ORILLION

                      Prepare ships for intercept.

                      Aye, sir.

                                ORILLION
                      Dammit, they followed us.

            He turns to Juni and Trent.

                                ORILLION (CONT'D)
                      We're going to have to buy some time.

            Juni looks at Trent and then back.

                                JUNI
                      We're on it.

            Orillion turns to the Doctors.

            CLOSE ON: Orillion.

                                ORILLION
                      Now, how do we make this tinkertoy into a
                      weapon.

            ACT FIVE

            A5RTC1 - EXT. ORDER'S SECRET BASE - SPACE

            The Osiris separates and heads out amid launching craft and
            anti-ship weapons.  Smaller ships go up against the Nomad
            attack ships. 

            A5RTC2A - INT. OSIRIS LANDING DECK

            Big music plays as Trent, King, Juni and others head for
            their ships.  The deck is alive with activity as they take
            off.

            A5RTC2B - EXT SPACE

            The Osiris on an intercept course.  In the distance a NOMAD
            Capitol ship.  Other smaller craft swarm.

            MISSION 20 (PARTS 1 - 10)

            See Mission Pack.

            - They engage and destroy the cap ship.

            - Trent lands back on the Order's base and has the ARTIFACT
            APPARATUS available to him for his ship.

            - They regroup and assault the NOMAD DYSON SPHERE.

            - They gain access and Trent flies to the point he needs to -
            to engage the Artifact.

            - Juni and King cover him.  In the process, King dies,
            leaving only Juni.

            - Orillion arrives with the HISPANIA FLEET as back up.

            - Juni and Trent are about to die when Trent finally gains
            access to the TOUCHSTONE SPHERE and engages the device.

            - THE FLUX of the sphere changes and an enormous change
            ripples throughout the sphere - the Nomads are affected
            immediately and a PORTAL opens in front of Trent; The sphere
            is now a node for travel - as it was intended, the Nomads are
            driven out or destroyed. 

            - The threat is over.  

            A5RTC3A - SPACE

            Trent and Juni head for home.

                                                            DISSOLVE TO:

            A5RTC3B - EXT. MANHATTAN - DAY

            Music.  Ships fly by.  Looks normal.  

            Overlay - Six weeks later.

            Slow push in to...

            A5RTC3C - INT. MANHATTAN BAR

            Trent sits alone in the bar, looking around, waiting.

                                JUNI (O.S.)
                      Red fang?

            Trent turns and sees Juni walking towards him, smiling.  He's
            surprised.

                                JUNI (CONT'D)
                      I never told you..I asked the bartender
                      about you the day we met.

            Trent looks at the Manhattan Bartender.  The Bartender winks
            and smiles, knowingly.

                                TRENT
                      What took you so long?

            She sits next to him.

                                JUNI
                      The debriefing took longer than usual.

                                TRENT
                      I guess you can't rush the President. 
                      You know, amnesty can be a pretty good
                      thing.

                                JUNI
                      Not to mention the generous cash reward.

            Her attention is drawn to A LIBERTY DIPLOMAT, who enters.  

                                JUNI (CONT'D)
                      Hang on, one second, I'll be right back.

            Trent watches her go for a moment.  Something catches his eye
            in a corner.  He gets up and walks towards it, looking
            around.  A shadow standing quietly observing.

                                TRENT
                      Orillion, I'm pleased to see you.  Let me
                      tell Juni, you're here.

            Orillion stops him.

                                ORILLION
                      Mr. Trent, even with the colonies
                      rebuilding and the contaminated human
                      population restored to normal, the threat
                      still isn't over. 
                          ( a beat)
                      For now, it's better if I stay less well
                      known.   

            Trent nods.

                                ORILLION (CONT'D)
                      For now, I just wanted to see how you two
                      were getting along--and to ask you if
                      you'd consider a proposition.

                                TRENT
                      What sort of proposition?

                                ORILLION
                      Oh, be the eyes and ears of The Order
                      here in Liberty.  

            Trent doesn't know what to say.

                                ORILLION (CONT'D)
                      Think about it.  Right now, enjoy your
                      vacation, Freelancer.  I'll be in touch.

            Orillion starts to go.

                                TRENT
                      I've been meaning to ask you...?

                                ORILLION
                      Yes?

                                TRENT
                      Casper?  Casper Orillion?

            Orillion smiles.

                                ORILLION
                      I wouldn't laugh...Edison.

            Touche.  That smarts. 

                                TRENT
                      The name's Trent.

            Trent hears Juni behind him.  He turns in time to see her
            come up with the Diplomat, arm in arm.  Trent looks back and
            Orillion is gone.  Trent smiles.

                                JUNI
                      Trent, let me introduce Mr. Harrison, our
                      newest Diplomat. 

            CAMERA backs away...

                                TRENT
                      Pleased to meet you.

                                HARRISON
                      The pleasure is mine, Mr. Trent. 
                      President Jacobi speaks highly of you. 

            ...and cranes up.

            Trent and Juni look at each other and smile. Their
            conversation fades as we -

            Camera continues to pull back to establishing position. Music

                                                          FADE TO BLACK.
