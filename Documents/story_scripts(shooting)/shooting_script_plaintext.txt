SCENE:	SPACE RTC 1: START: FREEPORT 7 DISASTER

SUPER:
Station Freeport 7, Sigma 17 System

SHOT 1:
Long shot of the station – slow dolly around. Far out in the Borderworlds, the large Zoner-controlled space station Freeport 7 goes about its business. Given the remote location of the station in the Sigma 17 System, space traffic is light – the only ships in the vicinity are part of a transport convoy that is preparing to leave the station and return to the Kusari home world on New Tokyo. The station is hailing the transport leader while the camera is slowly spinning around the station:

The transports are leaving near frame on the lower right as two fighters arc around from behind the station to upper frame left, arc across frame, and exit near lower frame right just as transports completely exit frame. Continue slow dolly in on the station’s command center.

SCENE:	SPACE RTC 1: END: FREEPORT 7 DISASTER

SCENE:	S002XE: MANHATTAN LANDING PAD - DAWN

SUPER:
Planet Manhattan, Liberty Colony

A transport ship enters the atmosphere and lands as the Liberty Newscaster’s voice breaks static and is heard.

DX_S002X_43_01_LI_NEWS
LIBERTY NEWSCASTER (VO)
(From static)
...one of the worst disasters in recent memory. In light of the current troubles in the colonies, President Jacobi has asked the LSF to investigate the sudden destruction of Freeport 7. No word yet on whether it was accidental or a deliberate attack. All ships in the area are being asked to assist in rescue operations. However, authorities say the death toll is expected to be high. The first handful of survivors arrived on Manhattan this morning.

Several people exit the ship and are met by two medics.

DX_S002X_44_01_MEDIC_01
MEDIC #1
We're here from Medical. Is there anyone seriously injured?

DX_S002X_45_01_TRENT
TRENT
One! Inside!

This is Edison Trent, twenties, Bretonian, young but has spent time in the Borderworlds frontier. The medics brush past him and reappear with an unconscious figure on a hovering Maglev-medevac. Doyle Lonnigan 45, murmurs softly with a nasty, gushing head wound. Trent looks down at him as he passes, and catches up with Medic #1.

DX_S002X_46_01_TRENT
TRENT
Make sure he lives. He owes me some credits.

DX_S002X_47_01_MEDIC_01
MEDIC #1
Your concern is touching. We'll do everything we can. It may take a while.

Trent and the Medics press on with their floating patient. A man walks into frame and draws deeply on a cigarette. We see that this man has a tattoo glyph on his face. This is Syd Montague, hard, dark features - twenties - the thief from the open. He and watches Trent and the others go.
Angle on: High wide of them walking.

DX_S002X_48_01_LI_NEWS
LIBERTY NEWSCASTER (VO)
Officially, the Liberty Security Force maintain that there is no proof Freeport 7's destruction was deliberate, but sources inside the LSF say they suspect the dangerous criminal organization, "The Order". Little is known of "The Order's" aims or its membership. We will keep you up-to-date as this story develops.

The scene ends as the player walks off the pad and the high-wide shot becomes the camera zero that we will become familiar with. We are in the game. The player now has the choice to go to any of the rooms on Manhattan. Eventually, he’ll make his way to the bar, where the following scene auto-plays.

SCENE:	S003X: INT. MANHATTAN BAR

Trent enters the bar and looks around. The News Vendor is present. People are mingling; some doing business, some just relaxing. He just wants to take a load off and wearily sits at the bar. The Manhattan Bartender, forties, heavy set, jubilant, a good listener, comes up.

TRENT
(To the Manhattan Bartender)
Sidewinder’s Fang!

MANHATTAN BARTENDER
All we have is Liberty Ale, friend.

DX_S003X_0301_TRENT
TRENT
(Flatly)
Fine!

The Bartender goes off. Trent notices a girl in a corner booth listening to a Liberty diplomat. As Trent watches her - she glances over at him, still listening to the political figure. This is Jun’ko Zane early twenties, of Kusari and Liberty parents. She is sharp and beautiful. After this brief moment, Jun'ko seamlessly rejoins her conversation with the droning Diplomat. Trent's gaze is broken as the Bartender sets his drink down.

DX_S003X_0401_MANHTN_BAR
MANHATTAN BARTENDER
(RE: the girl)
Her name is Jun'ko Zane. She's a tough one...

DX_S003X_0501_TRENT
TRENT
Oh, why's that?

DX_S003X_0601_MANHTN_BAR
MANHATTAN BARTENDER
She’s LSF. All business … if it’s a job you’re wanting that is.

DX_S003X_0602_MANHTN_BAR

On the other hand, if you’re looking for something more…

DX_S003X_0701_TRENT
TRENT
(Brushing off the implication)
Oh, the only thing I’m looking for right now is this drink.

Trent takes the first sip.

DX_S003X_1001_MANHTN_BAR
MANHATTAN BARTENDER
I know you!

DX_S003X_1101_TRENT
TRENT
No! No, I don’t think so.

DX_S003X_1201_MANHTN_BAR
MANHATTAN BARTENDER

MANHATTAN BARTENDER
You know, you’re lucky to be alive.

DX_S003X_1501_TRENT
TRENT
Ha!

The Bartender pours Trent another drink and one for himself.

DX_S003X_1601_MANHTN_BAR
MANHATTAN BARTENDER
This one’s on me, friend.

DX_S003X_1602_MANHTN_BAR
MANHATTAN BARTENDER
It’s the good stuff.

Trent takes it but then is apprehensive.

DX_S003X_1701_TRENT
TRENT
Why?

The Bartender raises his glass.

DX_S003X_1801_MANHTN_BAR
MANHATTAN BARTENDER
Because it’s not every day a man has the chance to start again, huh?

DX_S003X_1802_MANHTN_BAR
 (Toasting)
To your good fortune in Liberty, Sir!

The Bartender downs it - Trent is still apprehensive but...

DX_S003X_1901_TRENT
TRENT
It can’t get any worse!

He sips cautiously under the Bartender's watchful eye. Trent is pleasantly surprised.

DX_S011X_0401_TRENT
TRENT
(RE: the drink. He smiles.)
Thanks!

Trent finishes the drink. The Bartender is pleased and raises his glass again. The camera swings up and shows the player the default position of the room again. He can do whatever he wants, but eventually has to talk to Jun’ko before the story continues.

SCENE:	S004X: INT. MANHATTAN BAR

Trent approaches Jun'ko (Juni) at the corner table, where she is still in conversation with the Liberty Diplomat.

DX_S004X_0101_JUNI
JUNI
(To the Diplomat)
I understand what you are saying, but I don’t have nearly enough people.

The Diplomat has the manner of a serpent.

(Hushed tones)
Juni, the environment has changed.

DX_S004X_0202_LI_DIPLOMT

Oh, with groups like "The Order" taking more and more liberties - indeed now threatening our profits…

DX_S004X_0203_LI_DIPLOMT
LIBERTY DIPLOMAT

Juni sees Trent out of the corner of her eye. The Diplomat turns to see who she is talking to.

DX_S004X_0301_JUNI
JUNI
(To Trent)
Yes?

DX_S004X_03A01_TRENT
TRENT
(To Juni)
Ahem…

DX_S004X_0401_TRENT
TRENT
You Jun’ko Zane?

The Diplomat smiles and, knowing a Freelancer when he sees one, turns back to Juni.

DX_S004X_0501_LI_DIPLOMT
LIBERTY DIPLOMAT
I believe you have business to discuss.

DX_S004X_0601_JUNI
JUNI
(To the Diplomat)
Wait …!

Juni tries to protest but the Diplomat also knows a good exit when he sees one. He gets up.

DX_S004X_0701_LI_DIPLOMT
LIBERTY DIPLOMAT
I will leave this matter in your capable hands.

He walks past Trent. Dammit. She was not done with him.

DX_S004X_0801_TRENT
TRENT
Sorry! The bartender said that you work for the Liberty Security Force.

DX_S004X_0901_JUNI
JUNI
(Short – cutting him off)
And who do you work for, Mr… uh?

DX_S004X_1001_TRENT
TRENT
Trent. I work for myself.

DX_S004X_1101_JUNI
JUNI
What kind of ship do you have?

DX_S004X_1201_TRENT
TRENT
I lost mine … on Freeport 7.

This gets her attention.

DX_S004X_1301_JUNI
JUNI
I see!

DX_S004X_1302_JUNI
JUNI
Are you staying in Liberty long?

DX_S004X_1401_TRENT
TRENT
I’ve got a … friend who was injured in the attack. He’s in medical. I’ll be staying at least until he’s released.

DX_S004X_1501_JUNI
JUNI
Well, as it happens, I could use a good Freelancer, Mr. Trent.

DX_S004X_1502_JUNI
JUNI
(She gets up to go)
I’ll be in the Equipment Room later. You can meet me there.

DX_S004X_1503_JUNI
JUNI
Oh, and if we are gonna work together, call me Juni.

She brushes past Trent, who watches her go. The player, still in the bar, has again choices to visit other rooms, talk to other NPCs or to watch the news. Eventually, the player has to enter the Equipment Room in order to progress the story.

SCENE:	S005A: OFFER – INT. MANHATTAN EQUIPMENT ROOM

Trent enters the room. It’s barely lit. After a few seconds, he hears a noise and the lights turn on.
The lights turn on one-by-one and Trent starts walking to the Civilian Star Flier that is parked in the center of the room. He walks down the long axis of the ship looking for Juni. She walks up behind him.

DX_S005A_0201_JUNI
JUNI
(Walking towards him)
I’m pleased to see you. Are you ready to work for the LSF, Mr. Trent?

DX_S005A_0301_TRENT
TRENT
It’s just Trent. And yeah, I’m here to see what you have to offer.

DX_S005A_0401_JUNI
JUNI
Well, I’ve found this ship for you. It’s very basic and you won’t have jumpaccess yet, but it should be good enough for now.

DX_S005A_0402_JUNI
JUNI
This assignment will be easy. All you have to do is to baby sit a convoy of food and medical supplies.

DX_S005A_0403_JUNI
JUNI
You’ll be hooking up with the Escort CO, King. I’ll tell him to expect you.

DX_S005A_0404_JUNI
JUNI
That is – of course – if you’re interested?

The Offer Panel comes up:

ESCORT MISSION TO PITTSBURGH

Objective:	Escort a convoy of food and medical supplies from Fort Bush to the mining colony on planet Pittsburgh. The mission’s commanding officer, Michael King, is waiting to rendezvous in space near the Manhattan docking ring.
Difficulty:	LSF Intel has classified this mission as low risk. Pirate attacks are considered possible.
Reward:		2000 credits

SCENE:	S005B: ACCEPT – INT. MANHATTAN EQUIPMENT ROOM

DX_S005B_0203_JUNI
JUNI
King will be waiting for you near the docking ring in space. Okay? --I'll see you when you get back.

Trent nods and leaves her by the ship. As he does, the Camera reveals Syd lurking behind some cargo. The player finds himself back in the Manhattan cityscape. The launch button is now active and the player can immediately begin the missions. The player can also go explore Manhattan some more.

SCENE:	S005C: DECLINE – INT. MANHATTAN EQUIPMENT ROOM

Fine with me if you want to hang around Manhattan, but I think I'm your best shot at getting a ship.

DX_S005C_0202_JUNI
JUNI
I'll be here for a while in case you change your mind.

Trent walks off, leaving Juni by the ship. The player finds himself back in the Manhattan cityscape. The launch button is still not active, but the player can still explore Manhattan some more. Eventually, the only way to progress the story is to go back to the equipment dealer and accept the story mission.

SCENE:	S005D: RE-OFFER – INT. MANHATTAN EQUIPMENT ROOM

Trent walks in and finds Juni where he left her. She looks up when he enters frame.

DX_S005D_0101_JUNI
JUNI
Well, look who it is again. Have you thought it over, Trent?

DX_S005D_0102_JUNI
JUNI
My offer still stands: Take the mission and the ship is yours.

The Offer Panel comes up.

MISSION:	ESCORT TRANSPORT CONVOY TO PITTSBURGH

Trent selects the LAUNCH button while in Manhattan Cityscape. Note: Random Population is turned off during this cut scene.

SCENE:	SPACE RTC 2: START: DONAU ATTACK

Trent’s ship is coming out of the docking ring above Manhattan. Once Trent has cleared the structure that is in geo-stationary orbit above Manhattan, MICHAEL KING flies his LIBERTY LIGHT FIGHTER to a point very near Trent’s ship and sends him a comm. King is very business-like:

KING
(Filter - to Trent)
You must be Trent. I’m King, the CO of this mission. I contacted the lead transport of the convoy. They’ve completed pre-launch checks and are ready to go. Should be an easy run from here to Fort Bush and then on to Pittsburgh. Ready?

King enters “Guide” behavior. The next mission objective waypoint is now placed at the entrance of the Manhattan-Fort Bush Trade Lane. The targeting arrow guides the player to the correct location. The is a set of four King comms that help the player with the initial game play experience – they are timer based and turn off once Trent reaches a range trigger around the Trade Lane to Fort Bush.

After 60 seconds have elapsed and player hasn’t reached range trigger near Trade Lane:

KING
(Filter – business-like)
Hey, Trent, having trouble with your controls? Your HUD is showing the location of the waypoint in several places. A diamond shaped icon with a blue outline is showing you the direction of the waypoint. You can also check the contact list – it is marked there as “Mission Waypoint”. Selecting either one will show you direction and distance to the waypoint.

After 120 seconds have elapsed and player hasn’t reached range trigger near Trade Lane:

KING
(Filter – between concerned and annoyed)
Still having trouble? The easiest way to find where you have to go is by selecting the waypoint After you select it, you’ll either be facing the waypoint or you won’t. If you see a bigger diamond you’re still flying in the wrong direction and you have to turn your ship around. If you’re facing the correct way, you see the target as a blue diamond shape with a distance indicator. All you have to do is fly toward that point in space.

After 240 seconds have elapsed and player hasn’t reached range trigger near Trade Lane:

This is it, Trent. This is one of the major arteries through Manhattan space. We’re only taking it as far as Fort Bush. If we kept going we’d reach the Jumpgate to the Colorado system.

King and Trent arrive at Fort Bush

The area around Fort Bush is one of the main traffic hubs of the New York systems. Two Trade Lanes converge here and form an X-intersection. Three of the Trade Lane entrances are in immediate proximity to another, while the station is positioned slightly away from the lanes. The fourth connection, the lane to Pittsburgh, is behind Fort Bush and is several thousand meters away from the other three lanes.

Here we are. The transports are waiting near the station. I uploaded a new waypoint for you. Take the lead, Trent.

King enters “Guide” behavior. The next mission objective waypoint is now placed at the transports. The targeting arrow guides the player to the correct location. The is a set of four King comms that help the player with the initial game play experience – they are timer based and turn off once Trent reaches a range trigger around the transports at Fort Bush (DX_M01_0381_KING – DX_M01_0383_KING)

Once King and Trent are reaching the 300 m range trigger around the transport convoy

When King currently joins with the transports, manually drop the player from the formation so he's forced to join on the transports. This is abnormal behavior. The actual behavior in the code is that, if your leader joins a new formation, you join it automatically. We probably want to get consistent here and change the dialog to match. FYI.

Convoy comes out of the destroyed Trade Lane

While traveling through the trade lane, the convoy is attacked by four (very weak) pirate fighters (that are spawned during the travel). The pirates have temporarily disabled the Trade Lane ring at a specific location and are waiting for their targets. The hostiles immediately attack – two fighters engage King and Trent, the other two are going after the transports. King tells Trent to engage one of the enemy fighters.
The combat situation is such that after x number of minutes, additional pirate fighters will appear. Trent and King have to be reasonably efficient against these very weak enemies. If the lead transport or King is destroyed, the mission fails.

LSF FIGHTER Alpha 1
Understood!

King, Trent and Alpha Wing are flying toward the nearby fog zone. The two ships reach the exclusion zone with the depot that serves the pirate group as a base of operation. The depot is surrounded by two defense platforms and several other pirate ships that immediately attack when the duo appears.

DX_m01_1410_KING
KING
There!!! The Rogue Base!
(Sends a comm. to rest of the search parties)
To all units … this is Gamma 6. We’ve confirmed the location of the Rogue base. I’m transmitting new coordinates …

Several beeps.
DX_m01_1430_KING

(King continues)
All units … I can make out two defense platforms and an armored depot. We’ll need torpedoes to take it out. Over!

DX_m01_1431_KING
KING
Delta Wing is carrying torpedoes. They’re on their way, Trent. We can’t take out the base – the armor is too strong. But we can soften up their defenses by taking out the platforms. Let’s go.

One down … one to go!

Four more Rogue ships appear

After short while more pirates come out of the base to attack Trent and King.

DX_m01_1445_KING
KING
Trent, look out - more pirate ships closing in fast! I hope these reinforcements get here soon!

After the second platform has been destroyed, Alpha and Delta Wings appear

DX_m01_1446_KING
KING
(Urgent)
Second platform is down. Where are these torpedo bombers?!

Once both defense platforms are down, another attack wing with three LSF light fighters with torpedoes arrive in the exclusion zone. The player and King have to protect them and have to fight off the incoming enemy fighters. If the light fighters die due to enemy fire, more will arrive until the station has been destroyed. This means that loss of bombers is not a failure condition. The duo has to protect these ships until the station blows up (mission success event).

This is LSF Delta 1. We’re making our torpedo run at the station! Over!

Trent, let’s get clear. I’m uploading coordinates to Pittsburgh to your Neural Net. Let’s go.

OBJECTIVE: GO TO PITTSBURGH

They bail out of the fracas and head back towards Pittsburgh. It will take them roughly 45 seconds to clear the debris field.

DX_m01_1525_KING
KING
Good work back there, Trent. Not bad for a rookie!

DX_m01_1526_KING
KING
Something tells me I’m going to be seeing a lot more of you in the future.

DX_m01_1528_KING
KING
Our work today will hopefully put a dent in the growing crime problem we’ve been having in this system. Maybe now we can focus our full attention on The Order and anyone who supports them. That business with Schultzky… that can’t go unpunished!

King and the player exits the debris field near Pittsburgh

Finally, the duo appears near Steelton and the prison ship. King’s conversation with the player is interrupted when a comm. from Juni comes in.

DX_m01_1555_KING
KING
(Beeping sound)
Trent, Juni just sent me a message on the Secure Channel. Change of plans – I need to divert. Look – if you land on Pittsburgh, talk to one of the Deep Space reps … They’ll have something lined up for you. Meanwhile, I’m transferring your payment now. Thanks for your help. See you around.

King engages his cruise engines and flies toward the Trade Lane to Fort Bush. The player can follow King, but will eventually lose him once

King exits the player’s radar range

DX_m01_1580_JUNI
JUNI
(To Trent – fairly heavy static for long range ether comms)
Trent, this is Juni! Good job. King just told me how impressed he was with you. I hope this wasn’t too much for your first assignment. I wanted to meet up with you, but the attack on Schultzky has everyone rattled. 

DX_m01_1585_JUNI
JUNI
(To Trent – fairly heavy static for long range ether comms)
President Jacobi has ordered a full investigation to determine what can be done about “The Order”. It’ll likely mean more work for us soon. Meanwhile, why don’t you spread your wings a bit – familiarize yourself with the New York system, maybe see what work you can pick up. I’ll be in touch. Juni out!

The player now enters a free time period.

Well, now that we’re all here … The LSF has an important mission for you. Are you interested?

CAPTURE SEAN ASHCROFT

Objective:	Capture Artifact smuggler. The LSF has received information that a wanted criminal, Sean Ashcroft, is attempting to move a shipment of illegal alien artifacts into the New York system.
Difficulty:	LSF Intel has classified this mission as a moderate risk. Ashcroft will have strong defensive capabilities.
Reward:		25000 credits

Yeah, sounds good.

DX_S009B_0201_JUNI.WAV
JUNI
Alright, here are the details. The LSF has got a line on a smuggler who’s been moving artifacts in and out of Liberty space …

DX_S009B_0301_TRENT.WAV
TRENT
What sort of artifacts?

DX_S009B_0401_KING.WAV
KING
Alien. They’re very old and fetch a huge price among collectors as high art.

DX_S009B_0402_KING.WAV
KING (CONT’D)
Liberty purposely monitors and restricts their trade …

DX_S009B_0403_KING.WAV

Can I finish, please?

They both turn to her.

DX_S009B_0601_JUNI.WAV
JUNI
Okay. This smuggler’s name is Sean Ashcroft. He’s been under investigation for a while.

DX_S009B_0602_JUNI.WAV
JUNI (CONT’D)
Now we have information that he’s going to try and move a shipment into New York through the Colorado Gate. We want him!

DX_S009B_0603_JUNI.WAV

Your job is to stop the convoy before it reaches New York and bring him in for interrogation.

Now, he’s probably got help, so be careful.

DX_S009B_0605_JUNI.WAV

I’ll also have a scanner and tractor beam installed in your ship.

Her business done, she starts to go – but King stops her.

Wait, tell him about the bonus.

DX_S009B_0801_TRENT.WAV
TRENT
What about the bonus?

DX_S009B_0901_JUNI.WAV

I’ve got the access codes to the rest of the Liberty Gates. You can have them once you deliver Ashcroft.

DX_S009D_0201_KING.WAV
KING
Yes!

DX_S009D_0301_JUNI.WAV
JUNI
You’re sure this time?

After the scene has finished, the MISSION OFFER PANEL appears with more detailed information concerning the mission and offering choices to ACCEPT or DECLINE the mission.

SCENE:	S010X – EXT. PLANET MANHATTAN – LANDING PAD - DAY

This scene automatically plays once Trent has accepted mission 2 during scene S009B. When he leaves the bar, Trent walks onto the Landing Deck and catches a glimpse of a man standing on the deck, waiting for him: Lonnigan – with a large bandage over his head.

DX_S010X_0001_ORE_RNNR01.WAV
...so you see that THAT shipment IS the one covered in the contract. There is NO second shipment IF the price of the first one doesn't cover transportation and incidentals.

DX_S010X_0002_ORE_RNNR02.WAV
What shipment? You left it with the Lane Hackers...

DX_S010X_0003_ORE_RNNR01.WAV
(Cutting him off)
And they are a covered risk...we ALWAYS agreed on that. That is always what we said!

DX_S010X_0004_ORE_RNNR02.WAV
Are you done now? Can I say something?

DX_S010X_0005_ORE_RNNR01.WAV
Not if you're going to keep trying to cheat me out of another shipment. You ALWAYS do this! Every time we have a problem, you want to change the deal.

DX_S010X_0006_ORE_RNNR02.WAV
You'd be dead right now if it weren't for me. That's the LAST time I make a run with you.

DX_S010X_0101_TRENT.WAV
TRENT
Lonnigan, is that you? When did they release you for Medical?

DX_S010X_0201_LONNIGAN.WAV
LONNIGAN
(Calling to him)
You think you're safe, but you're not.

DX_S010X_0301_TRENT.WAV
TRENT
What are you talking about?

DX_S010X_0401_LONNIGAN.WAV
LONNIGAN
What do you think happened on Freeport 7, huh?

DX_S010X_0501_TRENT.WAV
TRENT
It was blown to dust! Like my ship, my ore shipment, and my million credits that, by the way, you still owe me.

Lonnigan narrows his eyes.

DX_S010X_0601_LONNIGAN.WAV
LONNIGAN
Easy come, easy go, Trent.

Trent closes the gap between them.

DX_S010X_0701_TRENT.WAV
TRENT
(Heated)
No! No, no, no! We had a deal …

DX_S010X_0801_LONNIGAN.WAV
LONNIGAN
A deal that died with the station.

He rubs his head.

DX_S010X_0802_LONNIGAN.WAV
LONNIGAN
(He rubs his head)
It’s all so long ago now.

DX_S010X_0803_LONNIGAN.WAV
LONNIGAN
It doesn’t matter anyway. They want us all dead.

DX_S010X_0901_TRENT.WAV
TRENT
Who wants us all dead?

DX_S010X_1001_LONNIGAN.WAV
LONNIGAN
(In fugue)
Men! Government men! They’ll find the manifest!

DX_S010X_1002_LONNIGAN.WAV
LONNIGAN
They’ll know who was there. They’re already after me.

DX_S010X_1003_LONNIGAN.WAV
LONNIGAN
(He looks around)
But I’m smart, I escaped from the Medical ...

DX_S010X_1101_TRENT.WAV
TRENT
Wait. You what??? You escaped?

DX_S010X_1201_LONNIGAN.WAV
LONNIGAN
(Slowly goes off)
Had to! They came for me, Trent! Because of what I saw!

DX_S010X_1202_LONNIGAN.WAV
LONNIGAN
On the station! I saw what did this to us! To me…

He puts a hand to his bandaged and bleeding head.

DX_S010X_1301_LONNIGAN.WAV
LONNIGAN
(Trailing)
There were these ships … but they weren’t there … they weren’t …

DX_S010X_1401_TRENT.WAV
TRENT
Lonnigan, you’re not making sense!

DX_S010X_1501_LONNIGAN.WAV
LONNIGAN
You don’t understand, they know me now … I’m not safe here anymore. None of us are!

DX_S010X_1502_LONNIGAN.WAV
LONNIGAN
Trent, we’ve got to get off Manhattan! I …

He stops dead in his tracks, eyes transfixed at something behind Trent's back.

Behind Trent, TWO LIBERTY AGENTS have their eyes locked on the pair. Lonnigan pales and starts to back away. Trent turns to see what he's looking at as Lonnigan suddenly bolts.

DX_S010X_1601_TRENT.WAV
TRENT
(To Lonnigan)
Hey, wait! Lonnigan!

Trent turns back in time to see one of the Agents bring a WEAPON to his shoulder and fire. A BLAST AND A SHARP WHIRRING SOUND fills the air.
POV SMART DART: A sporadic and violent shifting of the frame as it travels at lightening speed. The center of the picture is in focus, nestled as the outer edges smear to a blur. The dart narrowly misses Trent, who – out of reflex - ducks to avoid it and buries itself in the back of Lonnigan's neck.

DX_S010X_1503_LONNIGAN.WAV
LONNIGAN
Ugh!

DX_S010X_1504_LONNIGAN.WAV
LONNIGAN
Ah!

DX_S010X_1505_LONNIGAN.WAV
LONNIGAN
Uh!

DX_S010X_1506_LONNIGAN.WAV
LONNIGAN
Uhhh!

Lonnigan falls like a brick smokestack. The Agents push past the stunned Trent and pick up the prone Lonnigan. On the way back they pass Trent again.

One of the men quickly pulls a STUN BATON and jams it into Trent's chest without a word. Trent LIGHTS UP and a moment later, he slips out of frame and hits the ground hard.

DX_S010X_1702_TRENT.WAV
TRENT
Uh!

The two guards look down at him. The stun baton arcs again in frame, casting a white-blue pallor on the expressionless guards.
ANGLE ON: Tight on Trent's unconscious face. Two pairs of boots in the background walk off, dragging another.
FADE TO BLACK. OVER BLACK: Sounds of people talking far away.

DX_S010X_1801_JUNI.WAV
JUNI (V.O.)
(Softly and far away - like a distant memory)
Hey.

DX_S010X_1901_JUNI.WAV
JUNI (V.O.)
(Closer)
Hey!

TRENT'S POV - A shadowy image fills his vision. It turns slowly. Dreamily.
CLOSE ON: Trent's right eye also turning slowly. Open - trying to focus.

DX_S010X_2001_TRENT.WAV
TRENT
Unnnnn!

A LITTLE WIDER SHOT: - Trent’s face. A LOUD SLAP brings him back to reality.

DX_S010X_2201_JUNI.WAV
JUNI
Hey, wake up!

DX_S010X_2101_TRENT.WAV
TRENT
Ow!

TRENT'S POV: Juni comes into focus.
She and King hover over the stretched-out Trent.

DX_S010X_2301_KING.WAV
KING
Whoa! You look terrible! Are you alright?

DX_S010X_2401_TRENT.WAV
TRENT
I … I don’t know…

Crouched beside him, Juni helps him to sit up, bewildered.

DX_S010X_2501_JUNI.WAV
JUNI
What happened to you?

Trent tries to recall. Stun batons do a number on the noggin; scramble the neurons.

DX_S010X_2601_TRENT.WAV
TRENT
(Slowly - trying to remember)
Two men … they jumped me.
(Looking around)
Err … where is Lonnigan?

She helps him up - he's unsteady and a little bleary still. Camera rises with him. He looks for Lonnigan.

DX_S010X_2701_TRENT.WAV
TRENT
(Searching around)
They must have taken him. Ow! My chest!

DX_S010X_2801_JUNI.WAV

He’ll be fine. C’mon Trent, we’ve got work to do.

King smiles and smacks Trent on the back. He walks out to his ship. Trent and Juni watch King go.

DX_S010X_3201_TRENT.WAV

But don't go too far - I might need you again - soon.

She brushes past him. He watches her go.

The player now enters a free time period – the next segment plays once he’s qualified for the next story mission.

MISSION:	BECOMES AVAILABLE

This message plays whenever a story mission becomes available (restriction might be that the player has to land on a base for this to play).

Trent! This is Juni. I’m back from assignment and have a job for you. Meet me on Manhattan. I’ll fill you in on the details when you get here.

Once the player docks with Manhattan, the following scene automatically plays.

SCENE:	S012XA – INT. PLANET MANHATTAN – LANDING PAD

The Landing Pad is empty, with the exception of Trent and his ship. Lonnigan appears from behind. As Trent walks from his ship, he feels the muzzle of a gun in his back.

DX_S012X_0101_LONNIGAN.WAV
LONNIGAN
Don't move. Just listen!

Trent does what he says, partly recognizing the voice - but mostly being caught in the iron grip of a crazy person.

DX_S012X_0201_TRENT.WAV
TRENT
Lonnigan, where have you...?
 
Trent moves. Lonnigan jabs him in the ribs with his gun.

DX_S012X_0301_LONNIGAN.WAV
LONNIGAN
Stay still! I had to kill a man to escape today. What’s one more…?

Lonnigan backs away from Trent. When he turns, Lonnigan is gone. Trent shakes his head and slowly walks over to the BAR to meet Juni.

SCENE:	S012XB – INT. PLANET MANHATTAN – BAR

Trent enters the bar and looks for Juni. She isn’t there. He approaches the Manhattan Bartender.

(Slightly annoyed to be facing resistance)
I need you on this one, Trent. I’ll be waiting for you.

The player has the freedom to do whatever he wants. But once he is traveling to the California System, he encounters the following scene:

OBJECTIVE: MEET JUNI ON CALIFORNIA MINOR

The next time Trent arrives in the California System after his encounter on Manhattan.

As the player emerges from the Jumpgate, a Liberty Freighter hails and goes into follow mode.

FREEPORT 7 SURVIVOR
(Urgent and paranoid)
Something’s going on. I’m being followed … other survivors from Freeport have disappeared. Please meet me on Los Angeles.

Suddenly, a Liberty Navy patrol (three heavy fighters) appears from the Trade Lane to Mojave and flies directly toward Trent and the freighter.

Just land and I’ll tell you everything you need to know. I’ll wait for you in the Bar. Juni out!

SCENE:	S014A – INT. PLANET CALIFORNIA MINOR – BAR

Trent wanders into the bar – it's filled with the usual type of crowd seen on this type of terraforming stations. Rougher and dirtier than any other civilized place in the colonies. The scene almost has a Border World feel to it and is very noisy. Trent sees Juni, who raises a drink at him. She looks smooth in the corner, not really fitting into this crowd. Trent has a seat.

DX_S014A_0101_TRENT.WAV
TRENT
You know if you'd wanted to see me you could have picked a quieter place.

She smiles - jab.

DX_S014A_0201_JUNI.WAV

I’m trying to keep a low profile.

We hear the sound of breaking glass and a small scuffle.

DX_S014A_0301_TRENT.WAV
TRENT
Well, this is low -- I'll give you that.

DX_S014A_0401_JUNI.WAV

Ashcroft finally talked. You interested?

After the scene has finished, the MISSION OFFER PANEL appears with more detailed information concerning the mission and offering choices to ACCEPT or DECLINE the mission.

CONVOY ESCORT

Objective:	Escort a convoy from the Magellan Gate to the LSF Research Station Willard. The transports are carrying alien artifacts to be studied by LSF scientists on Willard.
Difficulty:	LSF Intel has classified this mission as a high risk. Attacks on the convoy considered very likely.
Reward:		40000 credits

Nice. So when do I leave?

DX_S014B_0401_JUNI.WAV
JUNI

Trent happens to glance up and see the News - where a picture of Lonnigan fills the screen. He freezes, getting up.

DX_S014B_0501_JUNI.WAV
JUNI
Hey!

DX_S014B_0601_TRENT.WAV

Shhh!

Trent approaches the News Monitor, followed by Juni. Trent (and we) can hear it better now.

LIBERTY NEWSCASTER (VO)
… ending the weeks of fear and apprehension... Again, after an exhaustive manhunt, the leader of “The Order”, the man known only as “Orillion”, was shot and killed while trying to escape into Rheinland space.

Trent looks at this in disbelief.

LIBERTY NEWSCASTER (VO)
Doyle Lonnigan. LSF officer Steven McKenna reported that Lonnigan appeared to be not of sound mind and that he certainly did not go quietly or without a fight. The shootout ended with McKenna and his team stop Lonnigan just short of boarding his ship, believed to be a stolen Liberty Navy vessel.

Juni looks at Trent as the rest of the Newscast becomes background.

DX_S014B_1101_JUNI.WAV
JUNI
How did you know that?

DX_S014B_1201_TRENT.WAV

It wasn’t before … it was during. He almost died. It doesn’t make sense.

He wasn’t smart enough to be a terrorist, let alone lead them.

They both look back up at the picture of Lonnigan … Idiot.

He was trying to tell me something …

DX_S014B_1601_LI_NEWS.WAV
LIBERTY NEWSCASTER (VO)
For those just joining us … Doyle Lonnigan, apparently a man of many names … the most recent being the elusive “Orillion”, the odious leader of the terrorist group: “The Order”. Now, justly dispatched by peacekeeping forces at the Liberty Border after a bloody shoot-out. His remains are in Liberty custody and are under guard, pending autopsy.

DX_S014B_1701_JUNI.WAV

Well, whoever he was, he’s dead now. C'mon, Trent, we've got another scumbag to ferret out. See you in space.

She walks off. Trent slowly turns and follows, still shaken.

Trent gets up and walks out of frame, leaving Juni.

If Ashcroft is telling the truth and there really is a traitor working inside the Liberty Military or the LSF, this will lure him out. It’s simply too good to pass up.

Trent and Juni reach San Diego station near the Magellan Jumpgate

Juni and Trent’s ship appear from the Trade Lane exit, which is located right at the edge of the large ice asteroid field. This area is very remote and traffic is zero. The massive Jumpgate to the Magellan System is directly in front of them. Near it is a small LSF police station.

The group enters the cylindrical exclusion zone in the ice asteroid field

The ships enter the Barrera Passage and are soon completely within the ice asteroid field. The passageway is tight and the marker buoys can be seen is distances of 1200 m from each other – much like the markers next to a highway. The transports – and therefore the entire convoy – fly with 80 m/s through the area. This means that it will take a minimum of 15 sec. to reach the first marker.

If Trent docks with the small station, he enters a typical Liberty Outpost Deck. A few people are working in the background. Trent can go to the bar or talk to the dealers on this station. This station serves as a safe point during this mission. Eventually, he’ll launch again and Juni will be waiting in space.

DX_M03_0890_JUNI
JUNI
Trent, we have to fly back to California Minor. We’ll take a shortcut this time. Come on, follow me.

DX_M03_0890B_JUNI
JUNI
Trent, we have to fly back to California Minor. We’ll take a shortcut this time. I’m uploading the coordinates. Let’s go!

Juni flies off and toward the ice asteroid field.

OBJECTIVE: GO TO CALIFORNIA MINOR

DX_M03_0910_JUNI
JUNI
Switching to a secure channel…
(Very concerned)
Something’s terribly wrong. I wanted to brief my CO on what happened with the convoy, but he’s been ordered to Manhattan. My contacts tell me that he’s actually been placed under arrest … for treason.
(Pause – she speaks slowly)
I tried to find out more, but all my friends at LSF Headquarters seemed to have disappeared. The only person I was able to contact was King – who’s still on Pittsburgh.

Trent and Juni enter the ice asteroid field near Station Willard. After a short flight to the edge of the exclusion zone, Trent and Juni enter the ice asteroid field. Juni contacts Trent after a few seconds in the field.

A group of three Rheinland Elite Fighters is heading for Juni and Trent

DX_M03_1025_JUNI
JUNI
Hold on, radar shows several ships on an intercept course.
(Small pause)
Wow! What are Rheinland Valkyries doing here?

DX_M03_1026_JUNI
JUNI
(To the incoming ships)
Attention Rheinland vessels. This is Commander Zane of the Liberty Security Force. Please identify yourselves. Over!

The Rheinlanders’ do not respond to Juni’s hail and keep coming closer.

DX_M03_1030_JUNI
JUNI
(To the incoming ships)
Rheinland vessels, please respond.
(To Trent)
Trent, stay alert, something’s wrong here.

The Rheinlanders’ radar blips go from gray to red. Once the Rheinland ships are within 700m to either Trent or Juni, they open fire.

DX_M03_1034_JUNI
JUNI
(To Trent)
They’re opening fire! Engage!

OBJECTIVE: ENGAGE HOSTILE SHIPS

After all three attackers have been destroyed

DX_M03_1040_JUNI
JUNI
That was the last one!

DX_M03_1055_JUNI
JUNI
(Juni is very confused about all this)
What’s going on? Rheinland military ships in the middle of Liberty? Why did they attack us?

Juni flies again toward California Minor.

DX_M03_1060_JUNI
JUNI
(Juni is very confused about all this)
Do you think this had anything had to do with the artifacts?
(A beat)
I just don’t get it … Rheinland? Even if there’s a traitor in the Liberty Military, what do Rheinlanders have to do with anything?

DX_M03_1075_JUNI
JUNI
We have to get to California Minor and talk to Walker.

OBJECTIVE: FLY TO CALIFORNIA MINOR

DX_M03_1100_JUNI
JUNI
He’s the Captain of a Liberty Navy Cruiser stationed here in California. He and I worked together on several operations in the past. I know we can trust him.

Juni and Trent hit range trigger 1500m away from California Minor Docking Ring

DX_M03_1130_JUNI
JUNI
Alright, Trent! I’m going to find Walker. Meet me in the bar in a few minutes.

OBJECTIVE: LAND ON CALIFORNIA MINOR

SCENE:	S015X – INT. PLANET CALIFORNIA MINOR – BAR

Trent enters the bar. The crowd is a little rougher than even last time he was here.  Juni sees him and waves him over.

DX_S015X_0101_JUNI.WAV
JUNI
(Calling)
Hey Trent, over here!

DX_S015X_0201_TRENT.WAV
TRENT
(He sits)
This place is starting to feel like home …

DX_S015X_0301_WALKER.WAV
WALKER (O.S.)
Don’t get too comfortable, we still have lots to do.

Trent looks up and sees MARCUS WALKER, 30's, dark hair, a career officer, almost the polar opposite of Trent, looking down on him.

DX_S015X_0401_JUNI.WAV
JUNI
Trent, meet Marcus Walker. He’s the Captain of a Liberty Cruiser. 

DX_S015X_0402_JUNI.WAV
JUNI
He’s just agreed to help us.

Walker breaks into a smile. He’s everything a Gentleman’s Military might require.

DX_S015X_0501_WALKER.WAV
WALKER
Always happy to help out the LSF! I’ve known Jun’ko for years.

DX_S015X_0502_WALKER.WAV
WALKER
(More to Trent - candidly)
Sorry to hear about your luck on Freeport 7. You were fortunate to get out alive.

DX_S015X_0601_TRENT.WAV
TRENT
So I’ve been told.

DX_S015X_0701_WALKER.WAV
WALKER
It seems that nowadays, if it isn’t smugglers, it’s “The Order” or some other scum trying to take advantage of us.

DX_S015X_0702_WALKER.WAV
WALKER
Piracy is running rampant. You know, Trent…

DX_S015X_0703_WALKER.WAV
WALKER (CONT’D)
… the Liberty Military is always looking for good pilots to join them full-time. It’s a worthy cause.

DX_S015X_0801_TRENT.WAV
TRENT
Thanks, but no thanks. Causes come and go. I think I’d rather just keep Freelancing, if it’s all the same to you.

DX_S015X_0901_WALKER.WAV
WALKER
Suit yourself… Now, if you excuse me, I need to make preparations.

Walker extends his hand.

DX_S015X_1001_WALKER.WAV
WALKER
Nice, meeting you, Trent! I’ll see you at the rendezvous.

Trent shakes it.

DX_S015X_1101_TRENT.WAV
TRENT
Thanks for the assist, Walker.

DX_S015X_1201_JUNI.WAV
JUNI
See you in space, Trent.

Trent nods as Juni exits with Trent.

SPACE: Trent launches from California Minor. Juni is waiting near the docking ring

DX_M03_1140_JUNI
JUNI
Walker and his cruisers are standing by on the far side of the planet. Let’s go.

OBJECTIVE: RENDEZVOUS WITH WALKER

Juni flies off. After only a few seconds, Juni gets hailed by King.

DX_M03_1150_KING
KING
Jun’ko, this is King.

DX_M03_1180_JUNI
JUNI
(Puzzled)
King … what’s going on?

DX_M03_1220_KING
KING
After you called me from Willard, I started to ask around a bit. I confirmed that your CO is in prison. There’s been a major shakeup in the higher ranks of the LSF…

DX_M03_1270_JUNI
JUNI
That’s only the tip of the iceberg. We were just attacked by Rheinland Valkyries on the way …

DX_M03_1280_KING
KING
What?!? Rheinlanders?

They reach a trigger near Walker’s cruiser convoy.

DX_M03_1290_JUNI
JUNI
King, we’re almost at our rendezvous point. I’ll contact you once we’re on Willard Station.

DX_M03_1300_KING
KING
Okay, I’ll try to find out what’s going on. Talk to you soon.

King flies off. Trent and Juni come upon Walker’s attack group (which consists of three Liberty Cruisers, location -7070, 100, 16588, east southeast of California Minor

DX_M03_1320_WALKER
WALKER
There you are. I’m switching to a private channel.
(Beeps … and a pause)
Juni, I just received new orders from High Command. My group has been ordered back to space dock for an inspection. We’re supposed to depart in half an hour.

DX_M03_1330_JUNI
JUNI (angered)
Did they give any reasons?

DX_M03_1340_WALKER
WALKER
They claim that there are inconsistencies in our maintenance records. Not sure why; we had complete workup only two months ago.

Suddenly:

DX_M03_1390_STATION_CONTROL
STATION CONTROL
(Lot of static … sounds of combat)
This is Research Station Willard. We’re under attack and are taking heavy damage. We won’t be able to hold out much longer. Repeat: This is Station Willard … we’re under attack.

DX_M03_1400_WALKER
WALKER
 (To his ships)
Forget about space dock. All ships go to battle stations! Set course for Station Willard.

The convoy is heading toward Willard.

OBJECTIVE: FLY TO WILLARD STATION

DX_M03_1405_WALKER
WALKER
Station Willard, this is Liberty Cruiser Attack Group South, Captain Walker speaking. We’re en route to your location and will be in range within a few minutes. What is your status, over?

The cruisers pick up speed and create a formation headed for Willard, hitting top speed in 10 seconds. Juni follows.

DX_M03_1410_STATION_CONTROL
STATION CONTROL
(Trying to stay calm)
We’re being attacked by Rheinland gunboats and a wing of attack fighters. Several torpedoes have hit the Harmony and the station is on fire… automatic defenses are failing and our fighters are being shot down like flies.

DX_M03_1415_WALKER
WALKER
Understood Willard! Try to hold them back until we get there.

Utah enters the ice asteroid field’s exclusion zone near California Minor.

DX_M03_1420_WALKER
WALKER
Willard, this is Attack Group South. We’re entering the asteroid field and will be at your location shortly.

DX_M03_1430_STATION_CONTROL
STATION CONTROL
(Sounds of combat – chaos in the background)
Acknowledged!
(A huge explosion is heard)
Two more torpedoes have hit the station! We’ve got plasma leaks in multiple sections! Hurry!

OBJECTIVE: DEFEND WILLARD STATION

DX_M03_1450_JUNI
JUNI
(Awed)
Good God, what a sight!

DX_M03_1460_WALKER
WALKER
Attack Group South! All fighter wings - engage the enemy. Cruisers! Break formation and protect Willard Station.

DX_M03_1470_JUNI
JUNI
Acknowledged! Trent, watch yourself! This is going to get rough.

The Liberty cruisers take advantageous positions near the gunboats, trying to “cross the T” so their broadside is faced by their opponents’ narrow, less armed end. The Rheinland ships turn to bring more of their guns to bear.
One minute after player arrival at Willard

DX_M03_1500_WALKER
WALKER
These gunboats are too fast for our turrets. Fighters, concentrate your fire on them!

Two minutes after player arrival at Willard, several bombers spawn carrying torpedoes. They attack the Liberty cruisers.

DX_M03_1510_WALKER
WALKER
I’m reading several Rheinland bombers …! All fighters, intercept the bombers before they can launch their torpedoes.

DX_M03_1520_JUNI
JUNI
Acknowledged… Trent, get on it!

Failure Cases: Juni dies, or the Utah is destroyed, or the Harmony is destroyed. All failure cases should immediately lock out all other terminal or comm. cases.

Comms for these cases follow:

IF		Failure. Juni dies

DX_M03_1550_WALKER
WALKER
Juni! No!!!

IF		Failure. Liberty Cruiser Utah dies

DX_M03_1580_JUNI
JUNI
Dear God! We’ve lost the Utah… I’m so sorry, Walker.

Ohio or Alabama is destroyed (first case).

DX_M03_1630_JUNI
JUNI
The Rheinlanders took out one of the cruisers!

Ohio or Alabama is destroyed (second case).

DX_M03_1640_JUNI
JUNI
Oh no, not another one...

Harmony is destroyed.

DX_M03_1650_WALKER
WALKER
Farewell, proud ship.

First Rheinland gunboat destroyed.

DX_M03_1660_JUNI
JUNI
YESSSS! That’s one down.

Winning Cases: All gunboats are destroyed. If any fighters remain, they turn and flee. Eight seconds after win state has been reached, the following occurs:
    • All enemy fighters and bombers flee into the asteroid field and are deleted once they are out of radar range.
    • The following dialogue plays.
    • After 3 seconds, all friendly cruisers stop firing and come to a halt.
    • After 3 more seconds, friendly fighters come to a halt.
    • After 10 seconds, cruisers slowly make formation. Friendly fighters start to patrol the perimeter.

DX_M03_1680_JUNI
JUNI
Got ‘em!

DX_M03_1690_WALKER
WALKER
We did it! All the gunboats are out of it…! 

DX_M03_1750_WALKER
WALKER
Jun’ko, I will have to stay here and deploy repair teams. Why don’t you join me in the station and we can discuss what is going on with the LSF and the Navy.

DX_M03_1760_JUNI
Okay. Trent, this will take some time and you’ve gone beyond the call of duty already. I’m transferring your payment now.

IF 		All cruisers survived

Money is transferred.

IF 		All cruisers didn’t survive

DX_M03_1761_JUNI
I have to deduct some of your payment since we failed to protect the cruisers.

Money is transferred.

DX_M03_1765_JUNI
(Pause)
I recommend that you take on a few jobs in the meantime. Once I know more, I will contact you again. Right now, I need to find out what is going on.

Juni flies to the station and docks. Even if the player lands, he won’t find her here. Eventually, he should move on and take random missions.

Player docks at Station Willard. He has few trading options, but at the bar, he gets a Generic Mission Offer sequence that tells him to meet King on California Minor.

MISSION:	BECOMES AVAILABLE

This message plays whenever a story mission becomes available (restriction might be that the player has to be in space this to play). Note to audio department: these comms should use a special “very distant” filter.

DX_M04_0000_JUNI
JUNI
(Worried – “very distant” filter)
Trent! This is Juni. Something is going on. I need your help. Meet me on Manhattan.

Once the player docks with Manhattan, the following scene automatically plays.

SCENE:	S019A – OFFER – EXT. PLANET MANHATTAN – LANDING PAD

We see Trent’s ship land next to Juni’s on the Manhattan Landing Pad. The large area is empty, with the exception of Trent and his ship. Juni suddenly appears from behind him on the pad. She looks upset.

DX_S019A_0101_TRENT.WAV
TRENT
Juni, what’s going on?

DX_S019A_0201_JUNI.WAV
JUNI
Over here!

She pulls him aside to speak more quietly. She makes sure that no one is watching them.

DX_S019A_0301_TRENT.WAV
TRENT
Hey, what’s wrong?

DX_S019A_0401_JUNI.WAV
JUNI
(Upset)
Nothing! Something! I don’t know yet.

DX_S019A_0501_TRENT.WAV
TRENT
What do you mean?

DX_S019A_0601_JUNI.WAV
JUNI
Ashcroft’s missing. He was on a Liberty Battleship, in a maximum security cell, surrounded by armed guards!

DX_S019A_0602_JUNI.WAV
JUNI
Trent, you don’t escape from that.

DX_S019A_0603_JUNI.WAV
JUNI
(Pause)
After our last assignment, I had a few more questions for him about his Rheinland connection. When I hot there, he was gone.

DX_S019A_0701_TRENT.WAV
TRENT
Who would transfer him without telling you?

DX_S019A_0801_JUNI.WAV
JUNI
He wasn’t transferred. Every record of him ever being arrested was wiped clean.

DX_S019A_0802_JUNI.WAV
JUNI
Even the guards were changed. They say they never even heard of Sean Ashcroft.

DX_S019A_0901_TRENT.WAV
TRENT
What do you think is going on?

DX_S019A_1001_JUNI.WAV
JUNI
I … I don’t know! But there’s more…

DX_S019A_1002_JUNI.WAV
JUNI
(She hesitates)
Walker. He’s gone, too.

DX_S019A_1101_TRENT.WAV
TRENT
Walker’s gone? But he’s the Captain of a Naval Cruiser.

DX_S019A_1102_TRENT.WAV
TRENT
Ship Captains just don’t go missing without someone noticing.

DX_S019A_1201_JUNI.WAV
JUNI
Neither do their ships. It’s listed as lost – five years ago.

DX_S019A_1301_TRENT.WAV
TRENT
Five years ago! That’s impossible!

DX_S019A_1401_JUNI.WAV
JUNI
People around us are disappearing, Trent.

Her voice trails off. It’s a moment that speaks volumes.

DX_S019A_1501_TRENT.WAV
TRENT
Well, we’re here… What’s our move?

DX_S019A_1601_JUNI.WAV
JUNI
We have to find out what’s going on.

DX_S019A_1602_JUNI.WAV
JUNI
The last place Walker’s ship was stationed was California, someone must have seen him.

DX_S019A_1603_JUNI.WAV
JUNI
That’s where we’ll start. Are you with me?

After the scene has finished, the MISSION OFFER PANEL appears with more detailed information concerning the mission and offering choices to ACCEPT or DECLINE the mission.

The Offer Panel comes up:

FIND WALKER

Objective:	Follow Juni to the California System to find Walker. The last known location of Walker’s ship was near California Minor.
Difficulty:	Since this is not an official LSF mission, there is no LSF Intel data available.
Reward:		20000 credits

SCENE:	S019B – ACCEPT – EXT. PLANET MANHATTAN – LANDING PAD

DX_S019B_0101_TRENT.WAV
TRENT
When do we leave?

DX_S019B_0201_JUNI.WAV
JUNI
In a few minutes! I need to finish up some business inside first.

DX_S019B_0301_TRENT.WAV
TRENT
Watch yourself!

DX_S019B_0401_JUNI.WAV
JUNI
I will.

Trent watches her walk towards the bar. As he does, the camera reveals that a figure is watching him near Juni’s ship in the shadows. He steps into the light. It’s Syd. Trent turns and sees him standing there. Trent stiffens, he is suspicious. The wind blows; it’s an awkward moment of silence. Trent keeps his hand near his sidearm.

DX_S019B_0501_SYD.WAV
SYD
(Calling to him)
Mr. Trent. It’s very important that you and I speak.

DX_S019B_0601_TRENT.WAV
TRENT
(Calling to him)
And why is that?

DX_S019B_0701_SYD.WAV
SYD
Because we’re the last two!

DX_S019B_0801_TRENT.WAV
TRENT
Last two what?

DX_S019B_0901_SYD.WAV
SYD
(Flatly)
Freeport 7 survivors, Mr. Trent! You and I are the last ones in Liberty.

DX_S019B_0901_SYD.WAV
SYD
Everyone else is either dead or missing.

DX_S019B_1001_TRENT.WAV
TRENT
(Walks toward Syd)
Wait, I know you. From the rescue ship! What happened out there?

Trent cautiously approaches him until they are face to face.

DX_S019B_1101_SYD.WAV
SYD
They were looking for something.

Syd hears a noise and looks off screen. So does Trent. The array of equipment and ships has created a small enclave – where there are no people – they are alone.

DX_S019B_1201_SYD.WAV
SYD
(Plainly)
I’m a thief, Mr. Trent.

DX_S019B_1202_SYD.WAV
SYD
I came to Freeport 7 to deliver something that a “certain party” wanted very badly.

DX_S019B_1203_SYD.WAV
SYD
Apparently, they weren’t alone.

DX_S019B_1301_TRENT.WAV
TRENT
You are telling me this is all because of you?

DX_S019B_1401_SYD.WAV
SYD
It’s not really about me, Mr. Trent…it’s about this.

DX_S019B_1402_SYD.WAV
SYD
(Holding up the artifact)
This is what they’re after.

The artifact glows. Trent has never seen anything like it.

DX_S019B_1501_SYD.WAV
SYD
And now they’re after us.

DX_S019B_1502_SYD.WAV
SYD
We need to get as far away from here as possible.

As he speaks, a small red dot appears on Syd’s body. It rises from his belly to his chest to his head. Trent notices this but before he can react – BANG! A sniper’s bullet rings out.

DX_S019B_1601_DRAKE.WAV
DRAKE (OS)
Hold it right there!

Drake, moves in with his weapon trained on Trent.

DX_S019B_1701_DRAKE.WAV
DRAKE
Get your hands up!

Trent raises his hands slowly.

DX_S019B_1801_TRENT.WAV
TRENT
Wow, wow, wow! I can explain!

Drake shoulders his weapon to fire and aims.

DX_S019B_1901_DRAKE.WAV
DRAKE
I have my orders. All Artifact smugglers are considered enemies of the state…

DX_S019B_1902_DRAKE.WAV
DRAKE
… and are to be shot on sight.

Drake’s finger tightens on the trigger stud.

DX_S019B_2001_JUNI.WAV
JUNI (O.S.)
FREEZE SOLDIER! I am an Agent with the Liberty Security Force!

They both look over and see Juni with her ID out. She is in attack stance with her hand on her gun.

DX_S019B_2101_JUNI.WAV
JUNI
This man is a Freelancer who is working with me on assignment.

DX_S019B_2201_DRAKE.WAV
DRAKE
(Not taking his eye off Trent)
I found him dealing in illegal artifacts …

She looks at Trent - who very slowly shakes his head - no.

DX_S019B_2301_JUNI.WAV
JUNI
(Coolly)
Then arrest him.

DX_S019B_2401_TRENT.WAV
TRENT
WHAT!?

DX_S019B_2501_DRAKE.WAV
DRAKE
I'm afraid I can't do that.

DX_S019B_2601_JUNI.WAV
JUNI
Soldier, you are bound by Liberty Code to uphold the laws. You don't have a choice.

DX_S019B_2602_JUNI.WAV
JUNI
If he's a suspect, take him into custody. The law protects him and ensures a fair trial.

The moment hangs in the air --as Drake narrows his eyes.

DX_S019B_2701_DRAKE.WAV
DRAKE
Not any more.

DX_S019B_2702_DRAKE.WAV
DRAKE
Uh!

DX_S019B_2703_DRAKE.WAV
DRAKE
Ughu!

DX_S019B_2704_DRAKE.WAV
DRAKE
Ahhhh!

He turns to shoot Juni. She shoots first. Two rounds rip through Drake and he goes down. Juni is in shock, having been saved only by years of training. She stands there - with her gun still pointed, smoke rises from the muzzle.

DX_S019B_2801_JUNI.WAV
JUNI
He was gonna kill me!?

A beat.

DX_S019B_2901_TRENT.WAV
TRENT
(His hands still up)
What do you mean "arrest him"?

She approaches Drake and kicks away his weapon. Gun still drawn.

DX_S019B_3001_JUNI.WAV
JUNI
He was going to kill us both!

Trent checks Syd’s body – he’s dead.  He picks up the artifact and his own weapon.

DX_S019B_3101_JUNI.WAV
JUNI
Who’s that?

DX_S019B_3201_TRENT.WAV
TRENT
I don’t know. But he had the right idea.

DX_S019B_3202_TRENT.WAV
TRENT
(Stands – to Juni)
Liberty isn’t safe for us right now. We’ve got to leave.

DX_S019B_3301_JUNI.WAV
JUNI
Trent, no! What about Walker?

DX_S019B_3401_TRENT.WAV
TRENT
We won’t be any good to Walker if we’re dead.
(Re: Drake)
Do you see this man? I don’t think he’s alone.

DX_S019B_3402_TRENT.WAV
TRENT
Juni, we need to stick together and we need some time and distance to sort this out.

Juni thinks about this. Finally, holstering her sidearm…

DX_S019B_3501_JUNI.WAV
JUNI
I know a place. Follow me...

They go to their ships and take off.

SCENE:	S019C – DECLINE – EXT. PLANET MANHATTAN – LANDING PAD

DX_S019C_0101_TRENT.WAV
TRENT
I’d like to but I can’t right now

DX_S019C_0201_JUNI.WAV
JUNI
Trent, I really need your help!

DX_S019C_0301_TRENT.WAV
TRENT
I just need some more time.

DX_S019C_0401_JUNI.WAV
JUNI
And how much time do you think we have left?

DX_S019C_0501_TRENT.WAV
TRENT
Enough! I’ll be back. Wait for me here.

SCENE:	S019D – REOFFER – EXT. PLANET MANHATTAN – LANDING PAD

Trent enters frame and is met by Juni

DX_S019D_0101_JUNI.WAV
JUNI
What the hell took you so long? I haven’t heard anything from Walker yet.

DX_S019D_0102_JUNI.WAV
JUNI
Hopefully someone on California knows something. Ready?

After the scene has finished, the MISSION OFFER PANEL appears with more detailed information concerning the mission and offering choices to ACCEPT or DECLINE the mission.

MISSION:	FOLLOW JUNI TO A HIDEOIUT

Launch from Manhattan: Random pop is turned off!

SCENE:	SPACE RTC 9: START: JUNI AND TRENT ABOVE MANHATTAN (20 SEC)

Trent and Juni have to get out of Liberty – having witnessed Syd’s killing at the hands of a Liberty police officer. Juni is still in shock, but realizes that they have to get away as quickly as possible. She and Trent are flying side-by-side toward Trenton.

DX_M04_0100_TRENT
TRENT
(Tense)
What’s the plan?

DX_M04_0110_JUNI
JUNI
(Stressed)
First to Fort Bush and from there to the Badlands … If they find the bodies on the landing pad, the Navy will lock down all Trade Lanes. We have to hurry!

The camera shows a wing of five Liberty Heavy Fighters on an intercept course. They fly in a star formation in a tight orbit around Manhattan.

DX_M04_0120_ROGUE_LEADER
ROGUE LEADER
(Commanding)
This is the Liberty Navy … cut your engines and prepare to be taken into custody.

The wing flies over the camera and approaches Juni and Trent’s position. Right before they are in firing range, the camera goes back to regular game play view.

SCENE:	SPACE RTC 9: END: JUNI AND TRENT ABOVE MANHATTAN

DX_M04_0130_JUNI
JUNI
(Panic)
Damn! They’ve blocked the Fort Bush Trade Lane? Come on, we’ve got to get out of here now!

Juni changes course and flies toward Newark station and the Trade Lane that leads to West Point.

DX_M04_0140_JUNI
JUNI
(Panic)
We have to get to West Point … it’s the only way out!

OBJECTIVE: FLY TO WEST POINT TRADE LANE

IF Player is not within 500m range of West Point Trade Lane after 30 sec.:

DX_M04_0150_JUNI
JUNI
(Panic)
They’re bringing in more and more ships. We gotta get out of here!

IF Player is not within 500m range of West Point Trade Lane after 60 sec.:

DX_M04_0160_JUNI
JUNI
(Panic)
We can’t stay here. Let’s go! 

When they turn toward the Trade Lane to West Point, they see that it is blocked by a Battleship Unity (visible from 12K away). Once Juni gets within 10000m of the West Point Trade Lane:

DX_M04_0165_JUNI
JUNI
(Panic)
The Unity is blocking the entrance! We’re surrounded! 

DX_M04_0170_JUNI
JUNI
(Panic)
Trent, I don’t think we can get out of this. 

A additional Cruiser and 6 more Liberty Heavy Fighters are approaching at high speed at a high vector from the northern hemisphere of Manhattan. All of them are hostile.

DX_M04_0175_JUNI
JUNI
(Panic – the resigned)
I’m picking up additional hostiles coming in from Manhattan. There’s just too many of them … I’m sorry…

Suddenly, a new group appears – coming in on a high vector. One Cruiser and six fighters! When these ships get within 1200m of the Unity their reputation changes from red to green. It’s Walker, King and five other LSF ships (flying Liberty Heavy Fighters!). Suddenly, the new wing changes colors in their HUD.

DX_M04_0180_KING
KING
(Controlled)
Juni, this is King. Proceed to West Point.

DX_M04_0190_JUNI
JUNI
(Surprised and relieved)
King!

King and his wing fly straight toward to Trade Lane …

DX_M04_0200_WALKER
WALKER
(Controlled)
Walker here! Jun’ko, take the Trade Lane. We’ll take care of the battleship.

All ships open fire with all gun ports and torpedo/missile bays.

DX_M04_0210_WALKER
WALKER
(Controlled)
All hands – fire at will! I repeat: all hands fire at will!

The two LSF Heavy Fighters launch torpedoes and the Cruiser is firing its main gun … after a few seconds, the mighty battleship disintegrates in an awesome explosion. Red, blue and Rogue squadron break off their attack and go after Walker’s wing.

IF Unity is at 60% health

DX_M04_0215_UNITY
BATTLESHIP UNITY
(Urgent)
Code red! I repeat code red! This is the Battleship Unity! We are under attack and taking heavy casualties.
(Klaxons blaring and men in panic in the background)
In need of immediate assistance, all available units please approach sector Manhattan01_01, I repeat, please approach sector…
(Explosion and static)

IF Unity is at 20% health

DX_M04_0217_UNITY
BATTLESHIP UNITY
(Urgency)
All hands abandon ship! I repeat, this is a general order! All hands abandon ….
(Explosions rip through the Unity)

The mighty battleship finally gives way…

DX_M04_0220_LSF_LAMBDA
LSF LAMBDA 1
(Controlled)
This is Lambda 1 to all fighter groups: move to intercept remaining fighters. Over!

The large ship shakes under the impact and starts to disintegrate after a few moments. After launching the torpedoes, Lambda wing breaks and scrambles to defend Walker. Walker’s cruiser moves into position where the Unity used to be and covers the West Point Trade Lane. King, Juni and Trent go to West Point, followed by the remaining Lambda wing ships.

DX_M04_0230_WALKER
WALKER
(Triumphant)
The Trade Lane is clear! Juni, Trent … get out of here! King, go with them. We’ll cover you! We’ll meet up with you at West Point.

DX_M04_0240_JUNI
JUNI
What about you?

DX_M04_0250_WALKER
WALKER
(Controlled)
I’ll be fine. My battle group is hiding in deep space. Something’s wrong, Jun’ko, and I have to find out what it is.
(Urgent)
Now, go!

The tradelane is now unlocked:

OBJECTIVE: TAKE WEST POINT TRADE LANE

Two Lambda wing ships are with them.

DX_M04_0260_KING
KING
(Tense)
This is gonna get rough. West Point will be alerted that we’re coming. What’s the plan?

DX_M04_0270_JUNI
JUNI
(Tense)
We have to get to the Badlands! There’s a place where we can hide.

DX_M04_0280_KING
KING
(Tense)
Understood! Lambda 4 and Lambda 5 – take flanking positions. We’re heading straight for the old tradelane to Ithaca station.

All of them reach the end of the tradelane near West Point. The station has launched two wings of fighters and its weapon platforms are hostile.

OBJECTIVE: TAKE TRADE LANE TO BADLANDS

DX_M04_0290_KING
KING
(Tense)
Hostile fighters detected. They’re closing fast!

DX_M04_0300_JUNI
JUNI
(Tense)
Here they come! Several wings of Navy fighters!

DX_M04_0310_LAMBDA_4
LAMBDA 4
(Tense)
We’ll provide you cover!

Juni flies toward the Ithaca Trade Lane.

DX_M04_0320_JUNI
JUNI
Understood! Quickly, Trent! We’re got to get to the Badlands. Follow me.

DX_M04_0320B_JUNI
JUNI
Understood! Quickly, Trent! We’re got to get to the Badlands. You take point.

IF Juni and Trent haven’t reached the tradelane after 30 sec.:

DX_M04_0330_KING
KING
(Urgent)
In a few minutes, this area will be swarming with Navy ships. You’ve got to go!

IF Juni and Trent haven’t reached the Trade Lane after 60 sec: several Liberty Cruisers spawn and fly toward their location.

DX_M04_0340_KING
KING
(Urgent)
Liberty Cruisers on an intercept course. Range: 10000m and closing. Projected intercept: 30 seconds.

All enemy ships focus their fire on the two Lambda wing fighters.

IF Lambda 4 is down

DX_M04_0350_KING
KING
(Urgent)
Lambda 4 is down. Quick!

IF Lambda 5 is down

DX_M04_0352_KING
KING
(Urgent)
Lambda 5 has been destroyed. We have to get out of here. Now!!

Juni, Trent and King (optionally with them) they enter the Trade Lane into the Badlands.

DX_M04_0354_JUNI
JUNI
(Relieved)
We made it! The Badlands will shield us from their scanners. I don’t think the Navy won’t follow us in here.

After 13 sec. of travel, the two ships arrive at the end of the Trade Lane. Either King was with them, or he arrives alone a few moments later.

DX_M04_0360_KING
KING
(Tense)
Dammit! That was close!
(A beat)
I think we managed to shake ‘em.

DX_M04_0370_JUNI
JUNI
(Thankful)
Thanks for getting us out of there. It started to look grim!

DX_M04_0380_KING
KING
(Friendly)
Thank Walker. When he told me that Trent’s name showed up on the Navy’s most wanted list, I knew you were in trouble.

DX_M04_0390_JUNI
JUNI
(Very surprised)
What?!

DX_M04_0400_KING
KING
He’s wanted for murder, artifact smuggling, treason and the destruction of Freeport 7. Quite an impressive list, actually.
(A beat)
Look, I have to rendezvous with Walker near Detroit. Stay low for a while. I’ll be in touch.

King flies off.

DX_M04_0410_JUNI
JUNI
(Somewhat in shock)
Trent, follow me. You’re going to meet a friend of mine.

DX_M04_0410B_JUNI
JUNI
Trent, I’ve uploaded new coordinates to your Neural Net. You’re going to meet a friend of mine. Let’s go.

DX_M04_0410C_JUNI
JUNI
Trent, I’ve uploaded new coordinates. You’re going to meet a friend of mine. Take point.

OBJECTIVE: GO TO COORDINATES

She flies off toward Benford station, which is a 13 sec. travel from their location.

DX_M04_0420_JUNI
JUNI
Stay clear of the energy disturbances – people say these things can destroy ships in an instant.

After a few seconds, the comm. system comes alive and the voice of an older man can be heard.

DX_M04_0430_VANPELT
VAN PELT
Approaching ships, this is a restricted area! Turn around at once!

Juni is delighted to hear his voice.

DX_M04_0440_JUNI
JUNI
Doctor Van Pelt. This is Jun’ko … Jun’ko Zane!

Surprise in his voice:

DX_M04_0450_VANPELT
VAN PELT
Juni … is this you? I’ve heard the news about you on the secure channel! What is going on?

DX_M04_0460_JUNI
JUNI
Too long to explain! We need a place to hide.

Finally, they reach the last of the waypoints and the Badlands clear into a large exclusion zone. A small Depot can be seen in the middle – and an energy disturbance in the distance.

DX_M04_0470_VANPELT
VAN PELT
You’re cleared to dock. I’ll meet you on the deck!

Juni and Trent land on the small depot.

SCENE:	S020X – INT. LIBERTY DEPOT BENFORD – COMMON AREA

Juni and Trent land on the Station and are met by the scientist - HERMAN VAN PELT, early sixties, kindly with white hair; that is whatever is left of it. The deck of the small station is empty. The only other person is Van Pelt.

DX_S020X_0101_VANPELT.WAV
VAN PELT
Juni! I’m glad you made it. The secure channel is buzzing with reports about you.

He greets Juni warmly, clearly they are old friends.

DX_S020X_0201_JUNI.WAV
JUNI
This is Trent.

DX_S020X_0301_VANPELT.WAV
VAN PELT
Van Pelt’s my name, young man. Welcome!

DX_S020X_0401_JUNI.WAV
JUNI
We just need to lay low for a while.

DX_S020X_0501_VANPELT.WAV
VAN PELT
Oh well, you’ve come to the right place.

DX_S020X_0502_VANPELT.WAV
VAN PELT
The only visitor I get is a supply ship once a month.

DX_S020X_0601_TRENT.WAV
TRENT
If you don't mind my asking: what are you doing this far out?

Van Pelt walks back to the science module, passing a window showing the ebb and flow of the galactic tides.

DX_S020X_0701_VANPELT.WAV
VAN PELT
Studying the anomalies in the Badlands! This station you see around you was part of a …

DX_S020X_0702_VANPELT.WAV
VAN PELT
…a grand experiment to fuel Liberty's waning resources.

DX_S020X_0703_VANPELT.WAV
VAN PELT
That was long before the Gas Mining Guild, of course.

DX_S020X_0801_TRENT.WAV
TRENT
I never heard about that.

DX_S020X_0901_VANPELT.WAV
VAN PELT
Nor would you -- there was an accident here.

DX_S020X_0902_VANPELT.WAV
VAN PELT
Liberty doesn't like to publicize its failures. It was abandoned … 

DX_S020X_0903_VANPELT.WAV
VAN PELT
… except for me of course.

DX_S020X_1001_TRENT.WAV
TRENT
You're here all alone?

DX_S020X_1101_VANPELT.WAV
VAN PELT
(Nodding)
Except for the machines! I like it that way. Not a lot of distractions.

They come to the console where the Secure Channel plays – it looks different than the News – more MP, same VO, though.

DX_S020X_1201_LI_NEWS.WAV
LIBERTY NEWSCASTER (VO)
To all Liberty Bounty Hunters and Peacekeeping Forces - be advised there is a bounty for two suspects wanted for questioning. Sending identity data now.

A flood of data appears off to the side, under still pictures of Juni and Trent.

DX_S020X_1301_LI_NEWS.WAV
LIBERTY NEWSCASTER (VO)
They are to be armed and extremely dangerous. End transmission.

Back to the scene: They both turn back to Van Pelt. He sits and lights his pipe.

DX_S020X_1401_VANPELT.WAV
VAN PELT
Juni, what is this all about?

DX_S020X_1501_TRENT.WAV
TRENT
I think it has something to do with this.

Trent holds up the Artifact. Even Juni is surprised.

DX_S020X_1601_TRENT.WAV
TRENT
Freeport 7 was destroyed for it. The man who had it was killed in front of me. We were almost next.

DX_S020X_1701_VANPELT.WAV
VAN PELT
(Intrigued)
Ah, I see. May I?

Trent nods. Van pelt adjusts a light and inspects the piece.

DX_S020X_1801_VANPELT.WAV
VAN PELT
Clearly an Artifact, but I've never seen anything like it.

Van Pelt mutters to himself … puffing his pipe.

DX_S020X_1901_VANPELT.WAV
VAN PELT
It’s very ancient ... rarified ... Nadnium crystal setting … 

DX_S020X_1902_VANPELT.WAV
VAN PELT
Still active! Hmmmmm. You might try Quintaine.

DX_S020X_2001_JUNI.WAV
JUNI
What, Doctor?

DX_S020X_2101_VANPELT.WAV
VAN PELT
Not what, dear, who: Professor Roland Quintaine ... of Cambridge.

DX_S020X_2102_VANPELT.WAV
VAN PELT
I can't help you with this, but he might. He's a respected Xeno-Archeologist.

DX_S020X_2201_JUNI.WAV
JUNI
I don’t understand. Help us what?

DX_S020X_2301_VANPELT.WAV
VAN PELT
Why, identify it!

DX_S020X_2401_JUNI.WAV
JUNI
I don’t want to identify it. I want to get rid off it!

DX_S020X_2501_TRENT.WAV
TRENT
We can’t get rid of it now. There’s a reason all of this is happening and we’re in the middle of it.

DX_S020X_2502_TRENT.WAV
TRENT
At least, if we keep it we have a bargaining chip for ourselves and maybe even Walker [NOTE: CUT].

DX_S020X_2503_TRENT.WAV
TRENT
If we find him! [NOTE: CUT]

She looks at Van pelt who puffs his pipe.

DX_S020X_2601_VANPELT.WAV
VAN PELT
Ah, I’m afraid your young man is right, my dear.

DX_S020X_2701_JUNI.WAV
JUNI
Oh this is just great!

DX_S020X_2801_VANPELT.WAV
VAN PELT
Don’t worry you’ll both be safe in Bretonia.

DX_S020X_2802_VANPELT.WAV
VAN PELT
Now, how to get you there…

Suddenly ALARMS FILL THE AIR.

COMPUTER VOICE
Liberty ships approaching!

They’re all startled. Van Pelt checks the console.

DX_S020X_3001_VANPELT.WAV
VAN PELT
Long range scan shows a Liberty Patrol. They must have followed you somehow, they never come out this far.

DX_S020X_3101_TRENT.WAV
TRENT
So much for laying low!

Van Pelt pushes some buttons out of frame.

DX_S020X_3201_VANPELT.WAV
VAN PELT
I'm setting the automatic defense systems to cover you. Take the back way.

DX_S020X_3301_JUNI.WAV
JUNI
(Inquisitive)
What back way?

DX_S020X_3401_VANPELT.WAV
VAN PELT
One of the things that was left behind here was a Jumpgate to Magellan.

DX_S020X_3402_VANPELT.WAV
VAN PELT
No one has used it since the disaster, but it still works.

DX_S020X_3403_VANPELT.WAV
VAN PELT
It's deep in the Badlands. I'm loading up the coordinates for you now.

DX_S020X_3501_JUNI.WAV
JUNI
What about you?

DX_S020X_3601_VANPELT.WAV
VAN PELT
I'll be fine!

He takes both of her hands in his. When she looks down she sees that he’s slipped her the Artifact.

DX_S020X_3701_VANPELT.WAV
VAN PELT
Take care of yourself.

She kissed the old man on the cheek.

DX_S020X_3801_TRENT.WAV
TRENT
Thank you.

DX_S020X_3901_VANPELT.WAV
VAN PELT
Good luck, young man.

DX_S020X_3902_VANPELT.WAV
VAN PELT
You must go! Now!

DX_S020X_4001_TRENT.WAV
TRENT
Come on!

The old man waves as they run for their ships. He settles down and calmly relights his pipe and waits for the patrol to come into range.

Player hits the launch button while on the Benford Depot Deck

Fire!

The incoming Liberty Fighters now begin to blast away at Benford Station as well as Juni and Trent.

DX_M04_0710_JUNI
JUNI
NO!!
(To Trent)
C'mon Trent, we've got to help him.

DX_M04_0712_VANPELT
VAN PELT
Juni, get clear! The defense system will hold them off.

DX_M04_0713_JUNI
JUNI
We're not leaving you.

Two or three of these fighters are killed or several minutes have passed. After which, a formation with three Liberty cruisers arrives.

DX_M04_0714_VANPELT
VAN PELT
I’m picking up more incoming ships.
(Can't hide his concern now)
Oh my … three Cruisers...they're closing fast.

DX_M04_0715_JUNI
JUNI
Doctor, you’ve got to come with us. We're coming in to pick you up.

DX_M04_0716_VANPELT
VAN PELT
There's no time, they're almost on top of us. You’ve got the coordinates to the Jumpgate. Go!

SCENE:	SPACE RTC 10: START: PATROL DESTROYS BENFORD STATION

The three large cruisers fly over the camera, which swings around and shows them facing the station. The Cruisers appear and start to fire almost immediately.

DX_M04_0820_VANPELT
VAN PELT
(Explosions– the voice is slightly distorted)
Juni! (Distortion) out of here! There’s (distortion) …thing you can do. Save yourselves! I will. …

The three large cruisers now take up a position outside the Depot and are firing at the small station. The Depot is on fire and heavy smoke is coming out of its docking ports. The few defense turrets that Van Pelt has available are barely able to deliver a scratch to the large vessels.  The two wings of Liberty fighters are positioned near the Cruisers and are standing by.

The Cruisers fire another salvo into the Depot.

DX_M04_0840_VANPELT
VAN PELT
(LOUD Explosion– the voice is highly distorted)
Juni! (Distortion) 

Another salvo that finally causes a chain reaction in the Depot! The camera switches quickly to an external shot of the station’s detonation and then returns to Trent.

DX_M04_0850_JUNI
JUNI
Noooo! 
(Pause – then angry)
They’ll pay for this!

SCENE:	SPACE RTC 10: END: PATROL DESTROYS BENFORD STATION

Juni heads for the large Cruisers…

DX_M04_0880_LIBERTY_CRUISER
LIBERTY CRUISER
Commander Zane – power down your engines and surrender NOW.

The remaining fighter wings fly toward their position.

DX_M04_0900_JUNI
JUNI
(Tense)
Alright, Trent, this is gonna be close! Follow me!

DX_M04_0900B_JUNI
JUNI
(Tense)
Alright, Trent, we have to get out of here. Head to the coordinates. Quickly!

As the two ships flee, the Liberty fighter wings get closer and open fire. Trent and Juni race into the Badland zone in the hope to find some cover.

DX_M04_0905_LIBERTY_CRUISER
LIBERTY CRUISER
They’re making a run for it. All fighter wings: break formation and pursue.

DX_M04_0910_JUNI
JUNI
(Tense)
We’ve got to make it to the Jumpgate.

The two fighters are racing to the Jump Gate. Once the duo reaches a range trigger around the gate, the following comm. plays:

DX_M04_0920_JUNI
JUNI
According to Van Pelt's data, we should be close to the Jumpgate.

When they hit the next range trigger:

DX_M04_0940_JUNI
JUNI
There it is. I hope the gate's still functional. I’m sending the access codes.

The Jumpgate activates. Juni is relieved.

DX_M04_0950_JUNI
JUNI
Thank God … it’s still working. Let’s go!

Juni flies toward the Jumpgate. When she is within 200m of the gate: And she jumps out in front of Trent.

Trent’s small ship flies into the huge gate and the jump tunnel appears. After a few seconds, he appears in the Magellan System. Juni is waiting on the other side.

DX_M04_0960_JUNI
JUNI
(A little sad)
Goodbye, Liberty...thanks old man...

DX_M04_0970_JUNI
JUNI
I’ve disabled the gate, but we can’t sit still. We have to keep moving.

The system is very near the Barrier field. It has no sun and most of the lighting comes from the Ice Nebulas and the Barrier field in the distance. The predominant colors are white and blue and the long stretch of the Barrier field commands much of the visuals. Two large Nebulas are nearby and asteroid field can be seen in the distance.

DX_M04_0990_JUNI
JUNI
The only station around here is Freeport 4. We’ll stop there for repairs and try to figure out what’s going on! Come on!

OBJECTIVE: TAKE TRADE LANE TO FREEPORT 4

Juni steers her ship in toward the Trade Lane that leads to Freeport 4. As they approach the TL (range trigger) heavily armed bounty hunters ships jump through.

DX_M04_1000_JUNI
JUNI
I have multiple signals on an approach vector. Prepare to engage!

DX_M04_1020_BOUNTY_01
BOUNTY HUNTER 1 (F)

Commander Zane … you are outmanned and outgunned. Surrender and we will spare your life.

DX_M04_1030_JUNI
JUNI
(To Trent – hasty and almost whispering)
Trent, there’s a bounty on our head. They’ll never let us out of here alive. We have to fight!

Juni attacks the bounty hunters ships.

DX_M04_1040_JUNI
JUNI
(To Trent - urgent)
Come on!

OBJECTIVE: ATTACK BOUNTY HUNTERS

DX_M04_1050_BOUNTY_01
BOUNTY HUNTER 1 (F)
(Threatening)
Target their engines. We need it intact.

IF player flies away from battle (x thousand meters).

DX_M04_1060_JUNI
JUNI
(To Trent)
Trent, where are you going? Stay here and fight!

After 30 sec. several ships emerge from the Trade Lane.

DX_M04_1070_LANEHACKER_1
LANE HACKER 1
Bounty Hunters ships: cease fire! These two are under the protection of the Lane Hackers.

Bounty Hunters 1 has to be invulnerable until this comm. played.

DX_M04_1080_BOUNTY_01
BOUNTY HUNTER 1 (F)
(Threatening)
Negative. These two have a big bounty on their heads. Clear out, there’s no bounty for hackers.

The Lane Hacker ships don’t wait long.

DX_M04_1090_LANEHACKER_1
LANE HACKER 1
(Resigned … then firm)
You leave us no choice … all ships, open fire!

DX_M04_1100_BOUNTY_01
BOUNTY HUNTER 1 (F)
(Surprised)
What the… are you crazy! You’ll pay for this!

The four Lane Hacker ships attack the Bounty Hunters in combination with Juni and Trent, are quickly destroying the remaining bounty hunter ships. Once the last ship has been destroyed:

DX_M04_1110_JUNI
JUNI
Last one!

DX_M04_1120_LANEHACKER_1
LANE HACKER 1
(A beat)
We’ve got to get out of here. Everybody is looking for you. Uploading a waypoint to your Neural Net! Come with us!

OBJECTIVE: FOLLOW LANE HACKER PATROL

The Lane Hacker ships turn toward the waypoint and start to fly off. (It leads in the exact opposite direction of the Trade Lane). The waypoint is the Lane Hacker base in the asteroid field.

DX_M04_1130_JUNI
JUNI
(Sincere)
Thank you.
(A beat)
But … why are you helping us?

DX_M04_1140_LANEHACKER_1
LANE HACKER 1
The enemies of Liberty are our friends.

IF Player is not following the Lane Hacker ships for 30 sec.:

DX_M04_1150_LANEHACKER_1
LANE HACKER 1
We have to leave. It’s just a matter of time before another patrol finds us.

IF Player is not following the Lane Hacker ships for 60 sec.:

DX_M04_1160_LANEHACKER_1
LANE HACKER 1
We can’t wait any longer. Fly toward the waypoint. Hurry!

Once they’re all flying toward the waypoint – after a few seconds.

DX_M04_1170_LANEHACKER_1
LANE HACKER 1
We’re maintaining a base in the asteroid field nearby. The Navy isn’t aware of its existence. It’s the only safe place for you right now.

OBJECTIVE: FLY TO LANE HACKER BASE

After less than 20 sec. of flight, Juni and Trent reach the perimeter of the Lane Hacker base. Suddenly, two ships join formation with Juni and send a comm.

DX_M04_1180_LANEHACKER_1
LANE HACKER 1
This is Delta Wing. We found them. Repeat: we found them.

DX_M04_1190_LANEHACKER_BASE
LANE HACKER BASE
Affirmative, Delta Wing!
(To Trent and Juni)
Ms. Zane, Mr. Trent … we’ve been expecting you. Our Commander wants to have a word with you, Ms. Zane. Please land immediately.

Juni begins to dock with the station – it is still locked for Trent at this point.

DX_M04_1220_JUNI
JUNI
Understood!
(To Trent)
Trent, repair your ship and buy whatever equipment you need. I’ll see you shortly.

OBJECTIVE: LAND ON LANE HACKER BASE

Juni docks with the Lane Hacker base. The player now has the option to land, or to wait outside the base. If the player flies too far away from the base, warning comms will fire and eventually fail the mission.

IF the player landed, give a Neural Net Objective on the base telling the player to launch when ready - Juni will be waiting outside the base when player reappears from the base

IF the player didn’t land, Juni re-emerges from the Lane Hacker base. after 30 sec.

DX_M04_1230_JUNI
JUNI
Well, I’ve got good and bad news. The good news is that there are Jump Holes nearby that lead to Manchester and Leeds.

DX_M04_1234_TRENT
TRENT
Leeds! My friend Tobias runs the Equipment Dealership there.

DX_M04_1236_JUNI
JUNI
The bad news is that Liberty has dramatically stepped up their policies against illegal artifacts. Rumors speak of hundreds of arrests – and there’s a reward on our heads … 
(Cynical laugh)
1 million credits – can you believe it? The artifact is the key. We have to find out what it is and why they want it so badly.

DX_M04_1240_LANEHACKER1
LANE HACKER 1
(Alarm sounds in the background- very urgent)
Alert! Unknown contacts are closing in fast! Launch all fighters!

Only a few seconds later four heavily armed Rheinland Heavy Fighters appear…

DX_M04_1250_LANEHACKER_BASE
LANE HACKER BASE
(Alarm sounds in the background- very urgent)
Picking up at least four Rheinland Heavy Fighters. Man all turrets.

DX_M04_1260_JUNI
JUNI
(Very urgent)
Rheinlanders again! They’re here for the artifact. Trent, engage!

OBJECTIVE: DEFEND STATION AGAINST RHEINLAND ATTACKERS

The station’s defenses are firing and four Lane Hacker defenders take on the incoming Rheinland ships. The Rheinlanders fire torpedoes into the Base.

DX_M04_1270_LANEHACKER_BASE
LANE HACKER BASE
(Alarm sounds in the background- panicking)
Incoming torpedoes!

A torpedo impacts on the ice asteroid that houses the Lane Hacker base.

DX_M04_1280_LANEHACKER_BASE

(Explosions and screams in the background- panicking)
The Command Center is hit.

Flames and smoke emanate from the ice asteroid base.

Hand over the artifact and you will be spared.

DX_M04_1300_JUNI
JUNI
(Very urgent)
Target the leader.

IF first Rheinland ship explodes:

DX_M04_1310_LANEHACKER_BASE
LANE HACKER BASE
(Alarm sounds in the background- triumphant)
Got one!

IF second or third Rheinland ship explodes:

DX_M04_1320_LANEHACKER_BASE
LANE HACKER BASE
(Alarm sounds in the background- triumphant)
Got another one!

IF last Rheinland ship explodes:

DX_M04_1330_LANEHACKER_BASE
LANE HACKER BASE
(Alarm sounds in the background- triumphant)
That’s it, last one!
(To Trent and Juni – apologetic and urgent)
Ms. Zane, we can no longer protect you. Leave Liberty while there’s still time. Good luck.

Talking to the ships outside (low priority comm.):

DX_M04_1340_LANEHACKER1
LANE HACKER 1
(Business-like)
Repair units, redeploy to the fires on level 3 and 4. Engineering, we have structural integrity loss near the landing dock.

DX_M04_1350_JUNI
JUNI
(Business-like)
It’s best if we split up. With that price on our heads, every bounty hunter in the colonies is going to be after us. I’ll go to Cambridge to find Professor Quintaine. Trent, find to your friend on Leeds and stay out of sight. I’m uploading the coordinates of the Leeds Jump Hole.

DX_M04_1360_JUNI
JUNI
I’ll contact you when I reach Cambridge.
(Sincerely)
Good luck and be careful!

OBJECTIVE: FLY TO LEEDS TO MEET TOBIAS

Juni takes off for the Jump Hole to Manchester. Trent heads for the Jump Hole to Leeds, which is only 20 seconds away. Once he arrives in Leeds, Juni sends the following comm.:

DX_M04_1370_JUNI
JUNI
(Static filter for very far away transmissions)
Trent, this is Juni. I’m on New London. King just contacted me. He’s with Walker. He said the Navy has been placed on heightened alert. Jacobi has classified all artifacts as illegal. And congratulations ... you and I are now Liberty’s most wanted criminals. Take on a few jobs and try to get a new ship! I’ll contact you when I find Quintiane. Juni out!

Trent ultimately has to get to Leeds – but he can do this now at his own pace. As Trent reaches a range trigger around Leeds, Juni contacts him.

DX_M04_1380_JUNI
JUNI
Trent! This is Juni. I’ve made it to Cambridge. No luck so far finding the Professor. I’ll contact you when I hear anything. Until then, keep a low profile. Every bounty hunter in the colonies is probably looking for us.

SCENE:	S021XA – EXT. PLANET LEEDS – LANDING SEQUENCE

It’s daytime. The brownish sky above the City of Leeds is filled with small civilian star trackers, star fliers and star blazers can be seen in abundance, as well as Bretonian fighters on patrol (flying in formation) and freighters and an (occasional) Bretonian elite fighter. Leeds is a minor colony of Bretonia and the density of ships populating the sky above the city is only moderate. When Trent lands on Leeds, we see his ship land on the pad.

SCENE:	S021X – INT. PLANET LEEDS – EQUIPMENT ROOM

Trent walks into the Equipment Room. There the Equipment Dealer, RICHARD TOBIAS, 50, a large Welshman with a moustache, is finishing a transaction with a couple of other ND pilots.

DX_S021X_0101_TOBIAS.WAV
TOBIAS
You won’t be sorry with that one, let me tell you.

DX_S021X_0102_TOBIAS.WAV
TOBIAS
You can trust Richard Winston Tobias to make you the best deal anywhere.

They seem satisfied and walk off after the transaction is complete. Tobias, pleased with himself, turns and sees Trent … he stops dead for a minute, then strides past him.

DX_S021X_0201_TOBIAS.WAV
TOBIAS
I was wondering when you might come back.

Tobias starts checking parts on the cart, his back to Trent.

DX_S021X_0301_TOBIAS.WAV
TOBIAS
Are you in some kind of trouble?

DX_S021X_0401_TRENT.WAV
TRENT
You might say that.

DX_S021X_0402_TRENT.WAV
TRENT
Hm!

DX_S021X_0501_TOBIAS.WAV
TOBIAS
You might also say "I told you so?"

Trent frowns and grinds his teeth. Tobias turns.

DX_S021X_0601_TOBIAS.WAV
TOBIAS
I didn't take the time to apprentice you so you could throw it all away on some fool scheme.

Trent sighs, taking his medicine but not liking it.

DX_S021X_0701_TOBIAS.WAV
TOBIAS
But you knew better. "The deal of a lifetime" you said. Remember? Eh?

DX_S021X_0702_TOBIAS.WAV
TOBIAS
(A beat)
Now look at you. That your Liberty hunk of junk on the landing pad?

DX_S021X_0801_TRENT.WAV
TRENT
Yeah.

Tobias wipes his hands as he talks. Walks right up to Trent.

DX_S021X_09001_TOBIAS.WAV
TOBIAS
Hmmm. I s'pose you'll be wanting some new parts on that thing...

Trent barely smiles. These two have a lot of history. Tobias puts a meaty hand on Trent’s shoulder.

DX_S021X_1001_TOBIAS.WAV
TOBIAS
It's good to see you, boy.

Trent clears his throat. Enough womanly emotions!

DX_S021X_1101_TOBIAS.WAV
TOBIAS
So are you back now - for good?

DX_S021X_1201_TRENT.WAV
TRENT
It’s complicated, Tobias. Seems like all of Liberty is after me!

DX_S021X_1301_TOBIAS.WAV
TOBIAS
I see.
(Rubbing his chin)
Well, the first thing to do is get rid of your ship… There’s likely to be a description out on it.

DX_S021X_1302_TOBIAS.WAV
TOBIAS
That’ll make you a popular target for Bounty Hunters.

DX_S021X_1303_TOBIAS.WAV
TOBIAS (CONT’D)
You’ll be needing something that blends in better around here…

DX_S021X_1304_TOBIAS.WAV
TOBIAS
(Beat)
I want you to go see the Ship Dealer on New London. I’ll tell him you’re coming.

DX_S021X_1305_TOBIAS.WAV
TOBIAS
He’ll have a ship for you.

DX_S021X_1401_TRENT.WAV
TRENT
I don’t think I have the credits for that.

DX_S021X_1501_TOBIAS.WAV
TOBIAS
For once, just do what I tell ya, boy.

DX_S021X_1502_TOBIAS.WAV
TOBIAS
I’ve been putting some aside. You’ll have enough. Come with me.

Trent can’t argue with Tobias. They both exit the frame. The player now has free time and can do whatever he wants.

OBJECTIVE: FREE TIME

MISSION:	BECOMES AVAILABLE

This message plays whenever a story mission becomes available (restriction might be that the player has to be in space this to play).

DX_M05_0000_JUNI
JUNI
Trent! This is Juni. I finally found a lead that might help us find Professor Quintaine. Meet me on Cambridge. I’ll be waiting for you in the bar.

OBJECTIVE: FLY TO CAMBRIDGE

SCENE:	S026A – OFFER – INT. PLANET CAMBRIDGE – BAR

The Cambridge Pub is pretty sparse; but it is peppered with a more professional and cultivated group than elsewhere. Trent sees Juni standing at the Bar as he walks in. He joins her.

DX_S026A_00A01_TRENT.WAV
TRENT
Hey…

DX_S026A_0101_JUNI.WAV
JUNI
I was wondering when you’d show.

She drinks. He pours himself one, too.

DX_S026A_0201_TRENT.WAV
TRENT
Did you find Quintaine?

DX_S026A_0301_JUNI.WAV
JUNI
(Shakes her head)
That’s the thing. The good doctor has disappeared.

DX_S026A_0401_TRENT.WAV
TRENT
You mean like the others?

DX_S026A_0501_JUNI.WAV
JUNI
No, not like them! This one left a trail.

DX_S026A_0502_JUNI.WAV
JUNI
But I’m gonna need your help, Trent. Are you with me?

After the scene has finished, the MISSION OFFER PANEL appears with more detailed information concerning the mission and offering choices to ACCEPT or DECLINE the mission.

The Offer Panel comes up:

FIND QUINTAINE

Objective:	Juni has a lead that might shed some light of the whereabouts of Professor Quintaine. He’s the key to learn more about the alien artifact.
Difficulty:	Since this is not an official LSF mission, there is no LSF Intel data available.
Reward:		20000 credits

SCENE:	S026B – ACCEPT – INT. PLANET CAMBRIDGE – BAR

DX_S026B_0101_TRENT.WAV
TRENT
That’s why I’m here. Count me in!

DX_S026B_0201_JUNI.WAV
JUNI
Good! What do you know about Xeno-Archeology?

DX_S026B_0301_TRENT.WAV
TRENT
Not much. Why?

DX_S026B_0401_JUNI.WAV
JUNI
Just let me do the talking and whatever you do, keep that Artifact out of sight.

DX_S026B_0402_JUNI.WAV
JUNI
I don’t want a repeat performance of Manhattan.

DX_S026B_0501_TRENT.WAV
TRENT
(A little frustrated)
Uh! Anything else?

DX_S026B_0501_JUNI.WAV
JUNI
Yeah, bring the bottle.

Trent picks it up and wonders... The scene continues in the bar, but at a different location and showing another angle. At a table, a drink is being poured. Juni is sitting next to Vance. Trent is standing over them and pouring the drink.

DX_S026A_0701_JUNI.WAV
JUNI
Very nice of you to see us on such short notice Mr. Vance.

DX_S026B_0801_VANCE.WAV
VANCE
When you said in your messages that you and Doctor Trent were from the Hammer Research Institute in Liberty…

DX_S026B_0802_VANCE.WAV
VANCE
… I could hardly refuse.

Trent looks over at Juni and mouths "Doctor"?  She motions for him to sit.

DX_S026B_0901_TRENT.WAV
(Silently)
TRENT
Doctor!?!

DX_S026B_1001_VANCE.WAV
VANCE
It’s not entire unusual for Doctor Quintaine to miss an appointment now and then … even one regarding funding.

DX_S026B_1101_JUNI.WAV
JUNI
We understand. We’d made it quite a while ago.

DX_S026B_1102_JUNI.WAV
JUNI
I’m just pleased the university put me in touch with you.

DX_S026B_1201_VANCE.WAV
VANCE
I do a lot of work for Dr. Quintaine – shuttling people and equipment back and forth to his research sites.

DX_S026B_1202_VANCE.WAV
VANCE
I’m sorry. Usually I can find him, but not today.

DX_S026B_1301_TRENT.WAV
TRENT
You mean you don’t know where he is?
(To Juni)
He doesn’t know where he is!

Juni kicks him under the table.

DX_S026B_1401_TRENT.WAV
TRENT
Ouch!

Vance quizzically looks at the two; they both smile like nothing happened.

DX_S026B_1501_VANCE.WAV
VANCE
Oh, he hasn’t been around for weeks. Probably doing deep research! He doesn’t always tell us.

DX_S026B_1502_VANCE.WAV
VANCE
Dr. Sinclair doesn’t even know where he is.
(Pause)
Have you spoken to her yet?

DX_S026A_1601_JUNI.WAV
JUNI
(Inquisitive)
No…?

DX_S026B_1701_VANCE.WAV
VANCE
Well, there’s your answer then. She knows just as much about their work as Quintaine, maybe even more.

DX_S026B_1702_VANCE.WAV
VANCE
She’s been doing field work for the Professor for years.

DX_S026A_1801_JUNI.WAV
JUNI
Has she? Do you think she’d mind if we looked her up?

DX_S026B_1901_VANCE.WAV
VANCE
No. Funding is what these scientists live for. Well, that and a little recognition, of course.

DX_S026A_2001_JUNI.WAV
JUNI
(Smiles a bit)
Of course! Can you tell us where Dr. Sinclair is now?

She motions for Trent to pour Vance another drink. He does.

DX_S026B_2101_VANCE.WAV
VANCE
Spraque in Omega 3! I’m afraid I can’t get her a message, though. It’s too far out.

DX_S026A_2201_JUNI.WAV
JUNI
That’s all right. We’ll go to her!

Trent gets it. She raises her glass and so do the others.

DX_S026A_2301_JUNI.WAV
JUNI
You’ve been very helpful, Mr. Vance. Thank you!

DX_S026B_2401_VANCE.WAV
VANCE
Ah, I think Dr. Sinclair will be quite pleased. Last week, nothing …

DX_S026B_2402_VANCE.WAV
VANCE
… this week, you and the Rheinlanders.

DX_S026B_2501_TRENT.WAV
TRENT
What Rheinlanders?

DX_S026B_2601_VANCE.WAV
VANCE
From the New Berlin Museum! Their also very interested in their work! You just missed them.

Trent looks over at Juni.

DX_S026B_2701_TRENT.WAV
TRENT
Oh, oh!

DX_S026A_2801_JUNI.WAV
JUNI
We gotta move! Get whatever you need here on Cambridge and meet me in space. Don’t take too long … Doctor!

DX_S026B_2901_TRENT.WAV
TRENT
I won’t!

Trent nods to Vance as they head for the door.  Vance just shakes his head.

DX_S026B_3001_VANCE.WAV
VANCE
(Amused at the antics)
Hm, academics!

SCENE:	S026C – DECLINE – INT. PLANET CAMBRIDGE – BAR

DX_S026C_0101_TRENT.WAV
TRENT
Thanks, but no thanks.

DX_S026C_0201_JUNI.WAV
JUNI
(Excited)
Trent, do you have any idea how difficult it’s been to find this guy?

DX_S026C_0301_TRENT.WAV
TRENT
I just need more time before I commit.

DX_S026C_0401_JUNI.WAV
JUNI
(Irritated)
Typical! Look, Trent, you need more time – take it!

DX_S026C_0402_JUNI.WAV
JUNI
Take all the time you need. I may still be here when you get back.

Trent finishes his drink.

DX_S026C_0501_TRENT.WAV
TRENT
Okay, see you later.

Trent walks out of frame.

DX_S026C0601_JUNI.WAV
JUNI
(Angry – calling after him)
Fine!

SCENE:	S026D – REOFFER – INT. PLANET CAMBRIDGE – BAR

DX_S026D_0101_JUNI.WAV
JUNI
(Pleased to see him)
Trent!
(A beat – more composed - recovering)
You’re back.

DX_S026D_0201_TRENT.WAV
TRENT
Yeah, what’s happening here?

She looks around. It's pretty dead. It sucks.

DX_S026D_0301_JUNI.WAV
JUNI
Still the hotbed of social activity!
(Pause)
I hope you’re here to work!

DX_S026D_0302_JUNI.WAV
JUNI
I was just about to hit up my contact for information about Quintaine, but now that you’re here we can do it together?

DX_S026D_0303_JUNI.WAV
JUNI
What do you say?

After the scene has finished, the MISSION OFFER PANEL appears with more detailed information concerning the mission and offering choices to ACCEPT or DECLINE the mission.

MISSION:	FLY TO PLANET SPRAGUE TO FIND DOCTOR SINCLAIR

Trent selects the LAUNCH button while in Cambridge Cityscape. Note: Random Population is turned off during this sequence.

Trent and Juni fly toward the Trade Lane that leads to the BW01 Jump Gate.

OBJECTIVE: TAKE TRADE LANE TO OMEGA 3 JUMP GATE

DX_M05_0100_JUNI
JUNI
Took you long enough! We don’t have any time to waste. Let’s go.

Juni flies toward the tradelane that leads to the Battleship Norfolk.

DX_M05_0110_JUNI
JUNI
These Rheinlanders could have left hours ago. We have to get to Sinclair before they do.

DX_M05_0115_JUNI
JUNI
I checked the Star Chart. Sprague is a remote planet in the Omega 3 system. It’s not too far from here.

Once they’ve reached the Trade Lane to the Norfolk:

DX_M05_0120_JUNI
JUNI
Maybe this Doctor Sinclair is all we need to find out more about our artifact.

They exit the Trade Lane at Battleship Norfolk.

DX_M05_0125_NORFOLK
NORFOLK
Incoming ships, this is the Norfolk. Your trajectory indicates that you are traveling to the Omega Systems. Be advised that tensions between the Bretonian Empire and Rheinland have escalated. A military confrontation cannot be ruled out.

DX_M05_0126_JUNI
JUNI
(To the Battleship)
Roger Norfolk! Our destination is Sprague in Omega 3. We have no intention to enter Rheinland territory.

DX_M05_0127_NORFOLK
NORFOLK
Understood! We have no reports of Rheinland activity in that system. Norfolk out!

DX_M05_0130_JUNI
JUNI
Hold on … we’ll take this Trade Lane. You lead, Trent.

OBJECTIVE: TAKE TRADE LANE TO OMEGA 3 JUMP GATE

DX_M05_0131_JUNI
JUNI
 (To Trent)
This entire conflict with Rheinland is about the damn Alien artifacts. Did you hear that President Jacobi is now trying to persuade the Queen to ban all artifacts here in Bretonia? I’m sure she has her reasons.

The duo reaches the Jump Gate to Omega 3:

DX_M05_0140_JUNI
JUNI
There’s the Jump Gate. You first, Trent!

OBJECTIVE: TAKE JUMP GATE TO OMEGA 3

Trent and Juni arrive in the Omega 3 System:

DX_M05_0150_JUNI
JUNI
The Star Chart describes Sprague as an unpopulated planet with no Trade Lane connections. We’ll have to fly from here to Freeport 1 and then through open space.

OBJECTIVE: TAKE TRADE LANE TO FREEPORT 1

Trent and Juni arrive at Freeport 1.

DX_M05_0160_JUNI
JUNI
This is where we have to leave the Trade Lane.

DX_M05_0170_FREEPORT_1
FREEPORT 1
Incoming ships! Be advised: Rheinland forces have set up blockades in Omega 7. No ships are allowed access to Rheinland space. All merchant vessels are to remain at Freeport 1 until the crisis is over!

DX_M05_0180_JUNI
JUNI
Freeport 1, we’re on our way to Sprague to bring supplies to an archeological expedition. Have you detected any Rheinland ships in the area?

DX_M05_0190_FREEPORT_1
FREEPORT 1
Negative! But Sprague lies beyond our patrol routes – if you are attacked, we won’t be able to send help.

DX_M05_0200_JUNI
JUNI
(To Freeport 1)
Understood! Thanks for the warning.

DX_M05_0201_JUNI
JUNI
(To Trent)
Trent, I’ve uploaded the coordinates to Sprague into your Neural Net. Come on.

OBJECTIVE: FOLLOW JUNI TO SPRAGUE

Juni flies into the direction of Sprague – the planet is roughly 60 sec. of flight (in cruise speed) away. After about 10 seconds (range trigger around Freeport 1) she comms the player:

DX_M05_0210_JUNI
JUNI
(Very concerned)
The situation is really getting out of control now. A blockade in Omega 7? Rheinland is now in direct violation of the Boorman Treaty.

DX_M05_0220_JUNI
JUNI
(Very concerned)
The colonies haven’t been this close to an open military conflict since the 80-Year War between Rheinland and the GMG.

DX_M05_0221_JUNI
JUNI
(Very concerned)
It all seems to have something to do with these damned artifacts. I hope this Dr. Sinclair can help us.

When the duo hits a range trigger about 20 seconds (6000m) away from Sprague.

DX_M05_0230_JUNI
JUNI
Vance gave me the frequency of the dig site beacon. I’m not picking up a signal yet … we probably have to get closer.

When the ships reach a range trigger near Sprague (3000m):

DX_M05_0240_JUNI
JUNI
Almost there! Still no signal!

When the ships reach a range trigger very near Sprague (1000m):

DX_M05_0250_JUNI
JUNI
We made it! You dock first, Trent.

Suddenly, several Rheinland ships uncloak directly in front of them and open fire.

DX_M05_0260_JUNI
JUNI
(Surprised – near panic)
RHEINLAND SHIPS! Where did they come from?

DX_M05_0270_JUNI
JUNI
(Urgent)
Break and attack!

OBJECTIVE: FIGHT RHEINLAND SHIPS

The fight starts and doesn't stop until the Rheinland ships are dead.

DX_M05_0280_JUNI
JUNI
(Triumphant)
Last one!

DX_M05_0290_JUNI
JUNI
(Tense)
We have to head down to the planet and get Sinclair the hell out of here. I hope we’re not too late! You first, Trent!

OBJECTIVE: LAND ON SPRAGUE

As the dock with the planet:

DX_M05_0300_JUNI
JUNI
(Tense)
We have to hurry! I have a bad feeling that there are more of the out there somewhere.

SCENE:	S027XA – EXT. PLANET SPRAGUE – LANDING SEQUENCE

Trent and Juni’s ships fly low over the hilly planet surface. This is a somewhat lengthy sequence compared to the usual landing approaches. The two ships are flying over the relatively flat and uninteresting surface for about 15 seconds.

DX_M05_0310_JUNI
JUNI
(Very puzzled and slight upset)
Those ships came out of nowhere! Looked like some kind of cloaking technology!? Not even the Liberty Navy has ever managed to get these to work!

DX_M05_0320_JUNI
JUNI
The dig site isn’t on any of the charts. We’re going to have to search for it.

DX_M05_0330_TRENT
TRENT
Let’s hope it’s still there and that these Rheinlanders didn’t find it already.

After another few seconds the two ships fly toward a large rock formation that looks like an ancient cliff. Finally, Juni picks up something on her scanners. A slowly recurring beep is heard.

DX_M05_0340_JUNI
JUNI
I’m getting a faint signal. It must be the dig site. Hold on … YES, I think that’s it!

A sound effect confirming the upload is heard in Trent’s cockpit. He now hears the faint beep inside his cockpit as well. Juni’s ship takes a sharp turn and flies directly toward the cliff. The beep gets louder and slightly more frequent.

DX_M05_0350_JUNI
JUNI
Looks like they had to excavate inside this rock formation to get to the dig site! Activating landing sequence.

Juni’s ship approaches what appears to be a hole in the ground – presumably the entry point for the dig site base. The frequency of the beep accelerates.

DX_M05_0360_JUNI
JUNI
This must be the entrance … I’m going in.
s
Juni slowly lowers her ship into the structure – Trent follows her. Within a few seconds, they’re surrounded by solid rock – only their headlights make it possible for them to see anything.

DX_M05_0370_TRENT
TRENT
(Worried)
No lights. No radio contact … this doesn’t feel right.

DX_M05_0380_JUNI
JUNI
Let’s hope for the best! Maybe they’re all digging for artifacts and don’t even know we’re coming.

After lowering through several hundred meters of solid rock, the beeping sound becomes very frequent – indicating that they’re about to reach their destination. The two ships finally get close to what looks like a standard Bretonian outpost deck. Once the two ships almost touch down on the surface, the lights come to and show a deck that is in relative disorder.

SCENE:	S027XA – INT. PLANET SPRAGUE – LANDING DECK

Trent and Juni's ships fly through the tunnel onto the deck. It is littered with equipment, cargo containers and tunnels that wind off. Trent and Juni hook up - with some urgency. Trent looks around, it's pretty crappy here.

DX_S027X_0201_JUNI.WAV
JUNI
Do you think we are too late?

DX_S027X_0101_TRENT.WAV
TRENT
We have to find Sinclair and get the hell out of here!

ANGLE ON: The Artifact, gleaming in Sinclair's hand.

DX_S027X_1101_SINCLAIR.WAV
SINCLAIR (O.S.)
And you say you got this where, exactly?

Juni and Trent sit on the steps of the impressive dig site, while a few other devoted assistants work behind them. SEVERAL LARGE PANELS WITH PARCHMENT ENCASED WITHIN lean against the site!

DX_S027X_1201_JUNI.WAV
JUNI
A thief – in Manhattan.

DX_S027X_1202_JUNI.WAV
JUNI
He was killed because of it. Now the same people are after us. We were told you could help.

She walks over to the ruins.

DX_S027X_1301_SINCLAIR.WAV
SINCLAIR
Look around you, Miss Zane. You are standing in the living history of the Daam-K’Vosh.

DX_S027X_1302_SINCLAIR.WAV

SINCLAIR
They were the inhabitants on much of our new home here in Sirius.

DX_S027X_1305_SINCLAIR.WAV
SINCLAIR
I’ve been working for years to piece together fragments of their past.

DX_S027X_1306_SINCLAIR.WAV
SINCLAIR
Their culture, technology, language … anything!

She walks up to the panels.

DX_S027X_1401_SINCLAIR.WAV
SINCLAIR
These panels here have been the core of my research.

DX_S027X_1402_SINCLAIR.WAV
SINCLAIR
They’ve shed light on some of their writings, but thanks to this piece, I’m close to unlocking their code.

She holds up the artifact.

DX_S027X_1403_SINCLAIR.WAV
SINCLAIR
Yes, I know quite a lot about this artifact, but not why anyone would want to kill for it.

DX_S027X_1501_TRENT.WAV
TRENT
Know anything about cloaking Rheinland ships?

DX_S027X_1601_SINCLAIR.WAV
SINCLAIR
Mr. Trent, I’m a scientist. I deal in facts, not fiction.

DX_S027X_1701_TRENT.WAV
TRENT
Well you better listed to the facts. A lot of people have died because of this trinket.

DX_S027X_1702_TRENT.WAV
TRENT
There’s something going on in the colonies. People are being killed.

DX_S027X_1703_TRENT.WAV
TRENT
Others have disappeared, like you colleague, Dr. Quintaine.

DX_S027X_1801_SINCLAIR.WAV
SINCLAIR
Quintaine hasn’t disappeared … he’s a recluse.

DX_S027X_1901_TRENT.WAV
TRENT
He’s gone under … that’s what I think. And a man like him only goes under for a very good reason.

DX_S027X_1902_TRENT.WAV
TRENT
I think he knew too much.

DX_S027X_1903_TRENT.WAV
TRENT
And with him gone that only leaves you!

DX_S027X_2001_SINCLAIR.WAV
SINCLAIR
This is ridiculous!

DX_S027X_2101_JUNI.WAV
JUNI
Is it? We find out that Rheinland has an active interest in your research and when we get here, we’re attacked …

DX_S027X_2102_JUNI.WAV
JUNI
… by Rheinland ships using a technology I have never seen before. Still not enough of a connection for you?

DX_S027X_2103_JUNI.WAV
JUNI
How about that friends of mine – trusted people in the Liberty military assigned to stop …

DX_S027X_2104_JUNI.WAV
JUNI
… illegal artifact smuggling are gone - like they were never there? Maybe they knew too much, too.

DX_S027X_2105_JUNI.WAV
JUNI
They just didn’t see it coming like Quintaine. Well, I do. And you should, too.

DX_S027X_2106_JUNI.WAV
JUNI
I figure those ships are coming back here soon and there’s no telling what else they’re bringing with them.

DX_S027X_2107_JUNI.WAV
JUNI
You, Doctor, can either be a live scientist on the run or a dead one in the ground!

DX_S027X_2108_JUNI.WAV
JUNI
Which will it be?

DX_S027X_2201_SINCLAIR.WAV
SINCLAIR
I’m not leaving without my work! Besides, how do I know you aren’t the enemy?

BOOM!!! The room shakes. Dust. An obelisk falls. This answers her question. Assistant #1 runs up to Sinclair.

DX_S027X_2301_ASSISTANT2.WAV
ASSISTANT 2
(Urgently)
Doctor, we’ve got over a dozen ships on our screen. I don’t know what kind. We didn’t see them coming.

DX_S027X_2401_JUNI.WAV
JUNI
I told you they were coming back!

Boom! More dust. Screams from her Assistants:

DX_S027X_2501_JUNI.WAV
JUNI
Come on, we’ve got to go!

DX_S027X_2601_SINCLAIR.WAV
SINCLAIR
(A decision – to the assistant)
Pack up what you can and send the others to the ships!

DX_S027X_2701_ASSISTANT2.WAV
ASSISTANT 2
Yes, Doctor.

DX_S027X_2801_SINCLAIR.WAV
SINCLAIR
(To Juni – urgent and fearful)
Alright, I’m with you!

They run off screen as another hit shakes the room.

SCENE:	S027XC – INT. PLANET SPRAGUE – SPACE BAR WITH WINDOW

Trent enters with Sinclair, Juni and Assistant #2, speaking into a communicator. They see several Rheinland ships pummeling the surface.

DX_S027X_3001_TRENT.WAV
TRENT
They’ll tear this place apart!

DX_S027X_3101_ASSISTANT2.WAV
ASSISTANT 2
(Urgent)
Doctor, the panels have been loaded into Mr. Trent’s hold.

DX_S027X_3201_SINCLAIR.WAV
SINCLAIR
Good! Get clear while you can.

Another blast rocks them.

DX_S027X_3301_JUNI.WAV
JUNI
Come on!

DX_S027X_3302_JUNI.WAV
JUNI (CONT’D)
Alright, let’s go. Come on!

They run for the deck.

SCENE:	S027XD – INT. PLANET SPRAGUE – LANDING SEQUENCE

They run for their ships and take off - up the shaft. With a fireball racing behind them ala Star Wars –high energy!

DX_S027X_3401_TRENT.WAV
TRENT (VO)
This is gonna be clooooose…

They barely make it out of the shaft and fly straight up toward the atmosphere.

SCENE:	SPACE RTC 12: START: SPRAGUE

Trent appears from the docking ring above Sprague. Six Rheinland Heavy Fighters and 2 Gunboats are awaiting them outside the docking ring and firing at the docking ring. It explodes just as Trent makes it through. Juni is taking heavy fire while trying to hold off these ships until Trent emerges. A wide camera shot captures the explosion of the docking ring and Trent’s JIT escape.

DX_M05_0390_SINCLAIR
SINCLAIR
Oh my God, they destroyed our base! My work…

DX_M05_0400_TRENT
TRENT
Never mind that! We’re outnumbered! We have to get out of here!

SCENE:	SPACE RTC 12: END: SPRAGUE

Surrounded by Rheinland ships, Juni and Trent are taking a beating.

SINCLAIR
(Tense, but calm)
Into the nebula! There’s a place we can hide …. I’m uploading the coordinates!

Just a few more seconds! We’ll lose them in the nebula!

IF Juni reaches the nebula interior

Doctor, where are we going?

DX_M05_0550_SINCLAIR
SINCLAIR
(Calm)
Baxter Research Station! It’s been abandoned for over a decade, but life support should still be functioning.

After a few seconds of flight: They fly toward the coordinates.

DX_M05_0560_SINCLAIR
SINCLAIR
You weren’t joking when you told me about ships appearing out of nowhere! Thank you for getting me out of there!

DX_M05_0570_JUNI
JUNI
You’re welcome. 

Baxter Station comes in visual range.

DX_M05_0580_SINCLAIR
SINCLAIR
This is it. We should land here. Keep your eyes open. They can’t be that far off.

They land.

SCENE:	S027X – INT. BRETONIA DEPOT BAXTER – LANDING DECK

The abandoned deck of the station is filled with equipment and junk. The lights don’t function properly and flicker – giving this scene an eerie feel. The three are standing next to their two ships on the deck – the large window behind them showing the beauty of the surrounding asteroid field.

DX_S028X_0101_TRENT.WAV
TRENT
I think we’ve managed to shake them for now.

DX_S028X_0201_JUNI.WAV

I hope you’re right!

DX_S028X_0301_SINCLAIR.WAV
SINCLAIR
Do you ever get tired of this?

DX_S028X_0401_TRENT.WAV
TRENT
The running and fighting?

SINCLAIR
(RE: the view)
No, this!

DX_S028X_0601_TRENT.WAV
TRENT
(Looks out of the window)
To tell you the truth, I don’t even pay attention anymore.

DX_S028X_0701_SINCLAIR.WAV
SINCLAIR
It’s a view like this that got me into Xeno-Archeology in the first place. I thought…

DX_S028X_0702_SINCLAIR.WAV
SINCLAIR
if the universe exists for eons…

DX_S028X_0703_SINCLAIR.WAV
SINCLAIR
… but I could only experience it for a brief moment of time, I wondered what a more ancient race must have thought of it?

DX_S028X_0704_SINCLAIR.WAV
SINCLAIR
(To Juni)
If you’re right and Quintaine has hidden himself … that means he’s still out there somewhere.

As they look out there, a Rheinland ship appears and opens fire - an alarm goes off as the station is hit.

DX_S028X_0801_JUNI.WAV
JUNI
They found us! We’ve got to get out of here!

DX_S028X_0901_SINCLAIR.WAV
SINCLAIR
Where? Where are we going?

DX_S028X_1001_TRENT.WAV
TRENT
(Has an idea)
To Leeds! I have a friend there. Come on!

DX_S028X_1101_SINCLAIR.WAV
SINCLAIR
(Unexpected vibration when the station is hit)
What was that?

Sinclair looks at Juni - no time to argue. They run for it as another hit rocks the station.

SCENE:	SPACE RTC 12A: START: BAXTER EXPLOSION

We see Juni and Trent fly away from the station. Torpedoes are incoming and the station goes off in a large explosion.

SCENE:	SPACE RTC 12A: END: BAXTER EXPLOSION

Six Rheinland Heavy Fighters are attacking the trio.

DX_M05_0585_JUNI
JUNI
(Panic)
The station is exploding! (Explosion)

DX_M05_0590_JUNI
JUNI
(Ready to fight)
We can’t outrun them this time. Trent … engage!

OBJECTIVE: FIGHT RHEINLAND SHIPS

After the last Rheinland ship has been destroyed.

DX_M05_0600_JUNI
JUNI
(Triumphant)
Radar is clear … nice fighting! But I’m sure they’ll be more. We have to get to Trent’s friend in Leeds. I’m sure the Jump Gate is being watched. Sinclair, what’s your status? Any ideas how to get out of here?

DX_M05_0610_SINCLAIR
SINCLAIR
I’m okay. There’s a Jump Hole to Cambridge nearby. That’s our best shot. From there, it should be easy to get to Leeds.

DX_M05_0620_JUNI
JUNI
Okay … let’s go!

Sinclair leads Trent and Juni to the Cambridge Jump Hole.

OBJECTIVE: GO TO CAMBRIDGE JUMP HOLE

DX_M05_0630_SINCLAIR
SINCLAIR
So, tell me, why did you come here? Surely not just to return the artifact to me?!

DX_M05_0640_JUNI
JUNI
 (More serious)
Doctor, ever since Trent came in the possession of the artifact, we’ve been hunted … first by the Liberty Navy, then bounty hunters, now Rheinlanders. Everybody seems to be after it … and we don’t even know what it is. A friend told us that Prof. Quintaine might be able to shed some light on this.

DX_M05_0650_SINCLAIR
SINCLAIR
And Quintaine has disappeared?

DX_M05_0660_JUNI
JUNI
His lab was destroyed. The only lead we could find was your pilot Vance. He told us where to find you … 

DX_M05_0670_JUNI
JUNI
We need to know what’s going on with this artifact. Why everyone is after it?

DX_M05_0680_SINCLAIR
SINCLAIR
No idea. I found it on planet Pygar and knew immediately that it was of great archeological significance. I was scheduled to fly to Cambridge to get Prof. Quintaine’s expert opinion … but then the artifact was stolen and I didn’t even go to Cambridge. I actually haven’t seen the professor in years.

DX_M05_0690_JUNI
JUNI
Damn! I guess the best thing we can do is to fly to Leeds and regroup.

A moment of silence! They reach the Jump Hole to Cambridge:

DX_M05_0700_SINCLAIR
SINCLAIR
There’s the Jump Hole.

DX_M05_0710_JUNI
JUNI
Trent, you go first.

OBJECTIVE: TAKE JUMP HOLE TO CAMBRIDGE

As they all arrive inside the Keswick Ice Field in Cambridge.

DX_M05_0720_SINCLAIR
SINCLAIR
We have to head to New London and from there to Leeds. I doubt the Rheinlanders will look for us here, but we need to stay sharp. Follow me!

DX_M05_0725_JUNI
JUNI
Trent, take the lead. Head for the new coordinates.

OBJECTIVE: FOLLOW SINCLAIR TO NEW LONDON

Sinclair leads them in the direction of the next Trade Lane. After about 10 seconds of flight, two Rheinland Heavy Fighters uncloak directly in front of them – both are hostile.

DX_M05_0730_JUNI
JUNI
(Alerted)
Dammit! They found us! Trent, engage.

Instead of fighting, the Rheinland ship immediately sends a comm. and their vibe changes to friendly.

DX_M05_0740_TRAITOR_1
TRAITOR 1
Wait. We mean you no harm. We’re here to warn you…

DX_M05_0750_JUNI
JUNI
(Cautious and distrusting)
Why should we trust you?

DX_M05_0760_TRAITOR_1
TRAITOR 1
Because we’re your only way out of here! The Rheinland Military is watching all Jump Gates and Jump Holes out of this system. You have an artifact they want, and they know that you’re here in Cambridge.

DX_M05_0770_JUNI
JUNI
(Cautious and distrusting)
Why are you telling us this?

DX_M05_0780_TRAITOR_1
TRAITOR 1
We deserted. Something is happening in Rheinland… we don’t exactly know what’s going on, but senior officers are starting to act strangely and orders are getting more radical every day.
(A beat)
But we have to leave now: a squadron of Heavy Fighters is on our tail. We are heading for a Jump Hole that will take us directly to Leeds.

DX_M05_0790_SINCLAIR
SINCLAIR
(Calm)
I believe them.

DX_M05_0800_JUNI
JUNI
(Resigned)
Fine! We’re coming with you.

DX_M05_0810_TRAITOR_1
TRAITOR 1
Follow us!

OBJECTIVE: FOLLOW RHEINLANDERS TO JUMP HOLE

The Rheinland ships lead the way – around the Cardiff Asteroid Field. After 10 seconds of silence, the Rheinland Traitor starts to prep Juni and Trent for the upcoming encounter.

DX_M05_0820_TRAITOR_1
TRAITOR 1
The Jump Hole will be watched, but they aren’t guarding it well because very few people know about it. We should be able to fight our way through.

DX_M05_0830_SINCLAIR
SINCLAIR
What’s the plan?

DX_M05_0840_TRAITOR_1
TRAITOR 1
Our wing was recently outfitted with cloaking devices … strange looking things, but they do work. We’ll cloak ourselves before we reach the Jump Hole. They will think that you’re an easy target, but we’ll give them a little surprise.

DX_M05_0850_TRAITOR_1
TRAITOR 1
We’re getting close. Activating cloak!

The two small fighters activate their cloak with a bright flash.

When they get within visual range of the battleship:

DX_M05_0860_JUNI
JUNI
Dammit. The Jump Hole is blocked by a battleship. What are we gonna do?

DX_M05_0870_TRAITOR_1
TRAITOR 1
We’re equipped with heavy torpedoes. A full salvo should be enough.

DX_M05_0880_TRAITOR_1
TRAITOR 1
We’re getting close. Activating cloak! Maintain radio silence.

OBJECTIVE: FLY TO LEEDS JUMP HOLE

The two ships that are flying in front of Juni and Trent are cloaking directly in front of them. After a few seconds, they’re coming up on the Jump Hole. A huge Rheinland battleship sits directly in front of it. Several fighters are in close vicinity.

DX_M05_0890_RH_BATTLESHIP
RHEINLAND BATTLESHIP
Commander Zane, Mr. Trent, we’ve been looking for you. Hand over the artifact and we will spare your life.

Nobody answers them. 

DX_M05_0900_RH_BATTLESHIP
RHEINLAND BATTLESHIP
Have it your way! All fighter wings, engage. Target their engines…

At this moment, the two Rheinland traitors uncloak and fire their torpedoes.

DX_M05_0910_RH_BATTLESHIP
RHEINLAND BATTLESHIP
It’s a trap! Incoming torpedoes – evasive maneuvers!

Seconds later the large battleship is hit and immediately catches on fire.

DX_M05_0920_RH_BATTLESHIP
RHEINLAND BATTLESHIP
We’re hit. All hands … abandon ship. Repeat …

The fuse is progressing and the giant ship finally detonates.

DX_M05_0930_RH_BATTLESHIP
RHEINLAND BATTLESHIP
Ahhhhhhhhh!

DX_M05_0940_TRAITOR_1
TRAITOR 1
We have to destroy the remaining fighters. Break and attack!

OBJECTIVE: DESTROY ALL HOSTIEL FIGHTERS

After heavy combat, all remaining fighters are destroyed.

DX_M05_0950_TRAITOR_1
TRAITOR 1
That was it! Let’s get out of here. Mr. Trent, you go first.

OBJECTIVE: TAKE JUMP HOLE TO LEEDS

Seconds after Trent jumps through the Jump Hole and arrives in the East Leeds Smog Cloud, the other ships arrive.

DX_M05_0960_JUNI
JUNI
We made it!
(To the Rheinlanders)
Thank you for your help.

DX_M05_0970_TRAITOR_1
TRAITOR 1
Your welcome … but this isn’t the end of it. Something has happened in Rheinland and I’m afraid the worst is yet to come. We’ll fly to the Norfolk and give ourselves up. Hopefully, someone in the Bretonia military will believe our story. Good luck to you.

With that, the two Rheinland ships fly off.

DX_M05_0980_JUNI
JUNI
The Trade Lane to Leeds is near. We should go.

OBJECTIVE: FOLLOW JUNI TO LEEDS

As the get out of the cloud and fly through open space toward the Trade Lane:

SINCLAIR
Who are we meeting on Leeds?

DX_M05_1000_JUNI
JUNI
An old friend of Trent’s! This will be interesting…

They reach the Trade Lane to Leeds.

DX_M05_1010_JUNI
JUNI
Take the Trade Lane. We’re almost there.

Don’t mention it. Land on Leeds … we’ll meet in the Equipment Room.

OBJECTIVE: LAND ON LEEDS

SCENE:	S029X – INT. PLANET LEEDS – EQUIPMENT ROOM

It's well past midnight. Tobias is heading out the door when he is met by Trent, Juni and a Maglev-droid. At first he is startled, until Trent shushes him.

DX_S029X_0101_TOBIAS.WAV
TOBIAS
Uh! Trent, where have you been? I’ve been worried about you!

Tobias looks over and sees Juni.

ANGLE ON: Tobias' POV as he starts at Juni's spiked boots - one foot tapping, up her thighs, waist, her crossed arms and then to her face. He stokes his beard.

DX_S029X_0201_TOBIAS.WAV
TOBIAS
(RE: Juni)
But I see you’ve been in good company!

Juni, meet Tobias!

Richard Winston Tobias, Esquire. Dear Lady.

She's taken aback by his antics, but it is flattering.

DX_S029X_0601_TRENT.WAV
TRENT
(Aside - hesitatingly)
Tobias, sort of – raised me.

DX_S029X_0701_JUNI.WAV
JUNI
And from such humble beginnings … your head grew to its present size?

Sinclair comes around the corner and enters.

DX_S029X_0801_SINCLAIR.WAV
SINCLAIR (CONT’D)
(To Juni)
We’re all clear! Nobody followed us.

DX_S029X_0901_TRENT.WAV
TRENT
Good.

TOBIAS
(Surprised)
And who do we have here? Another girl?

TOBIAS
(Laughing)
Tell me, boy … what have you been doing?

DX_S029X_1201_TRENT.WAV

Tobias, we need a safe place to lay low for a while.

DX_S029X_1301_JUNI.WAV
JUNI
Doctor, can you decipher the writing on the artifact?

DX_S029X_1401_SINCLAIR.WAV
SINCLAIR
I can do most of it, but not alone. I need Quintaine.

DX_S029X_1501_TRENT.WAV
TRENT
Damn.

DX_S029X_1601_JUNI.WAV
JUNI
Like it or not, Trent. If we are to get some answers, we’re going to have to find Quintaine.

DX_S029X_1701_TRENT.WAV
TRENT
I knew you were going to say that.

DX_S029X_1801_JUNI.WAV
JUNI
Look, this may take some time…

DX_S029X_1802_JUNI.WAV
JUNI
Sinclair will do everything she can on her work and I will dig around for any leads on Quintaine.

DX_S029X_1803_JUNI.WAV
JUNI
You try and scare up some business. We could probably use the credits.

DX_S029X_1804_JUNI.WAV
JUNI
Anyway, I can’t have you lounge around here like a big ox waiting for things to happen.

As she turns she sees Tobias, who fits the description to a Tee. He just stands there grinning.

JUNI
(Annoyed)
What?!

Oh, brother!

Trent leaves them.

MISSION:	BECOMES AVAILABLE

This objective appears when the mission becomes available.

OBJECTIVE: INCOMING MESSAGE STORED FOR COCKPIT PLAYBACK

This message plays when the player subsequently launches (the player has to be in space this to play).

DX_M06_0100_JUNI
JUNI
(Very far away processing)
Trent, I have news. Dr. Sinclair has made good progress in analyzing the artifact. But she’s now reached a point where she can’t continue without the help of Quintaine. Our best lead is a pilot Quintaine sometimes works with, a guy named Dexter Hovis. He’s running a gambling operation on an abandoned battleship in the Dublin System. You should start there.

After playback this objective appears and objective status is conferred to Battleship Hood in Dublin.

OBJECTIVE: FIND DEXTER HOVIS IN DUBLIN SYSTEM

Eventually, Trent reaches the “Hood”, which is now operated by the Independent Miners Guild. Once the player lands on the Hood, the objective changes:

OBJECTIVE: TALK TO BARTENDER ABOUT HOVIS

On entering the bar, the following scene automatically plays.

SCENE:	S032A – OFFER – INT. BATTLESHIP HOOD – BAR

Trent walks into the “Grotto” bar of the huge ship – and it looks as seedy as the people in it. There’s nobody in here that doesn’t have a reason to stay out of sight. If you need to disappear in Bretonia, this is the place to go. The bar is quite full – mostly older people, shady guys and a few pilots – all pretty much misfits of society. Everybody is drinking and smoking - and it is to noisiest place that Trent has ever seen. When Trent walks in, everyone looks at him.  He’s certainly not a usual customer and the people here are very suspicious of outsiders. Finally, he walks up to the Bartender, who is the strong silent type.

DX_S032A_01A01_HVIS_XTR_1.WAV
DEXTER HOVIS
YEAH!

DX_S032A_0101_TRENT.WAV
TRENT
I’m looking for a guy named Dexter Hovis. Have you seen him?

The Bartender looks him over without a word. Finally, he points to a man standing in the window watching the asteroid field outside. Trent nods to the Bartender and approaches DEXTER HOVIS, 30s with rough edges. A crazy racer pilot who's a cross between a "Wild Catter" and a burned out thrill seeker! He stands with his back to the room, totally engrossed.

DX_S032A_0201_TRENT.WAV
TRENT
You Dexter Hovis?

Without turning around, the man answers. His mind seems very far away.

DX_S032A_0301_DEXTER.WAV
DEXTER HOVIS
I’m Hovis!

DX_S032A_0401_TRENT.WAV
TRENT
I'm a friend of Quintaine's. I understand you do some work for him every now and then. I've got a message for him!

DEXTER HOVIS
(Sighs deeply - bored)
Ah, you know, I'd love to spend all day jawing with you, Bretonian, but I really only talk to Racers.

He turns to face Trent.

DX_S032A_0701_DEXTER.WAV
DEXTER HOVIS
Unless of course, you are a Racer and you're looking for a challenge ... say ... me, perhaps.

DX_S032A_0702_DEXTER.WAV
DEXTER HOVIS
In that case, I'll talk to you all day - providing of course you live.

DX_S032A_0703_DEXTER.WAV
DEXTER HOVIS
You see I have a hard time finding people who'll race against me. What do you say, tenderfoot?

After the scene has finished, the MISSION OFFER PANEL appears with more detailed information concerning the mission and offering choices to ACCEPT or DECLINE the mission.

The Offer Panel comes up:

RACE DEXTER HOVIS

Objective:	You have to race Hovis through the asteroid field race course. If you win the race, he will give you information on where Professor Quintaine is hiding.
Rules:	Since this is not an official LSF mission, there is no LSF Intel data available. The race consists of three laps around a circular race track that has been build inside the asteroid field. No weapons fire is allowed. Leaving the race course at any time during the race is expressly forbidden. Failure to follow these rules or compete effectively could cost you your life. 
Reward:		30000 credits (prize money)

SCENE:	S032B – ACCEPT – INT. BATTLESHIP HOOD – BAR

DX_S032A_0401_TRENT.WAV
TRENT
You’re on!

DX_S032B_0201_DEXTER.WAV
DEXTER HOVIS
Good! I’ll meet you outside!

He smiles a jackal's smile and shoulders past Trent as he looks outside. He walks out of the frame, leaving Trent alone in front of the large window.

After accepting, the objective updates:

OBJECTIVE: LAUNCH TO SPACE WHEN YOU ARE READY TO RACE

SCENE:	S032C – DECLINE – INT. BATTLESHIP HOOD – BAR

DX_S032C_0101_TRENT.WAV
TRENT
No way! I didn’t come here to race – I came here for information.

DX_S032C_0201_DEXTER.WAV
DEXTER HOVIS
Well, I don’t do information lessen you win. And you can’t win lessen you race.

DX_S032C_0202_DEXTER.WAV
DEXTER HOVIS
If that doesn’t suit you then maybe you should leave!

Trent slowly recedes out of frame.

By selecting the DECLINE button in the Mission Offer Panel, Trent has decided not to accept the story mission 6 yet. Trent can hang out on the battleship and watch the news, engage in conversations or trade – or fly to any other location in the Freelancer universe. The Story Star is still active and now reads:

Dexter Hovis is still on the Battleship Hood. He has information where Prof. Quintaine is hiding, but you have to race him first before he will give you the information. You can usually find him in the bar of the “Hood”.

The bar of the “Hood” is still under control of the story mission. Trent can talk to Dexter Hovis again by selecting the figure (if he didn’t leave the bar), or by simply selecting the bar icon (if he did leave the bar) – at which point the re-offer scene S032D automatically plays.

SCENE:	S032D – REOFFER – INT. BATTLESHIP HOOD – BAR

Trent appears behind Dexter again. Dexter is looking out of the window and doesn’t turn as Trent approaches him.

DX_S032D_0101_DEXTER.WAV
DEXTER HOVIS
My deal hasn't changed, Bretonian. Race me and I'll tell you what you want to know.

He turns to face Trent.

DX_S032D_0102_DEXTER.WAV
DEXTER HOVIS
Or get the hell off my ship.

DX_S032D_0201_TRENT.WAV
TRENT
You’ll tell me about Quintaine?

Dexter turns toward the window again. He’s obsesses with racing.

DX_S032D_0301_DEXTER.WAV
DEXTER HOVIS
I'll tell you about the Queen's secret hideaway, if you like ... all you have to do is win.

After the scene has finished, the MISSION OFFER PANEL appears with more detailed information concerning the mission and offering choices to ACCEPT or DECLINE the mission.

MISSION:	RACE AGAINST DEXTER HOVIS

Upon launch from the Hood, a space RTC scene flies Trent’s ship to the beginning point of the race. Hovis – in a heavily modified ship (Bounty Hunter Heavy Fighter) flies next to him as they make it to the start line.

SCENE:	SPACE RTC 13A: START: FLY TO START OF RACE

Hovis flies next to the player and sends a comm. The two ships fly side-by-side to the starting position of the race. An announcer can be heard in the background. Throughout critical points during the race, the player hears low-volume bettor conversations from the Hood, encouraging him or Hovis and giving tips. All these comms have a static filter and light dinner-table ambiance sounds. The role of the announcer should be read similar to the announcer in a horse race:

RACE:		BETWEEN THE HOOD AND THE STARTING POINT

These background voices are barely perceptible and play while Trent and Hovis are flying toward the starting point of the race. This should sound like a wrestling or boxing match announcer:

DX_M06_0650_ANNOUNCER
ANNOUNCER
We have a challenger! His name is Trent … against our very own Dexter Hovis! Place your bets! Make it quick!

DX_M06_0660_A-SPECTATOR

You’re betting on the newcomer? 3000 on Hovis!

DX_M06_0690_B-SPECTATOR
B-SPECTATOR
5000 credits on that guy Trent.

DX_M06_0700_D-SPECTATOR
D-SPECTATOR
Kiss your credits goodbye. Hovis hasn’t lost in over a year.

DX_M06_0710_B-SPECTATOR
B-SPECTATOR
Have you seen the odds? It’s 30:1!

DX_M06_0770_C-SPECTATOR
C-SPECTATOR
There's nothing to watch here… who's up next?

DX_M06_0780_D-SPECTATOR
D-SPECTATOR
That new guy won’t even .make it to the first ring!

These background voices are barely perceptible and play while Trent and Hovis are flying toward the starting point of the race.

DX_M06_0110_DEXTER
DEXTER
[Laughs]
I was beginning to think you were scared.

DX_M06_0120_TRENT
TRENT
Not a chance. I said I’d race you. Here I am!

DX_M06_0130_DEXTER
DEXTER
[Laughs]
I like your attitude, Bretonian.
[Taunting]
It’ll be a shame to see you burn. But hey, that’s the price of sportsmanship.

DX_M06_0140_TRENT
TRENT
I may surprise you, Hovis.

DX_M06_0150_DEXTER
DEXTER
[Laughs]
We’ll see soon enough, won’t we?

RACE:		TRENT AND HOVIS GET CLOSE TO START POSITION

When Trent and Hovis reach a range trigger near the starting position of the race, the announcer closes all bidding:

DX_M06_0200_ANNOUNCER
ANNOUNCER
Betting is closed, people! All bidding is closed.

RACE:		TRENT AND HOVIS REACH THE START POSITION

The two ships reach the starting position of the race. A BUOY calls the two racers into position and asks if they know the rules:

DX_M06_0160_BUOY
BUOY
[Automated computer voice]
Welcome, racers! You have selected a one-lap race. Do you need a review of the regulations?

DX_M06_0170_DEXTER
DEXTER
[Impatient]
Course, I don’t; you hunk o’ junk.
[To Trent]
I built this damn thing, but its memory banks are busted. Simple rules, Bretonian, one round, no shooting or bumping … and if you stink it up or chicken out on the course, you’ll make me angry! And we don’t want that!! Ready?

The announcer starts the countdown:

SCENE:	SPACE RTC 13A: END: FLY TO START OF RACE

The player gets ship control back … and Hovis literally jumps from the starting line. As the player passes through the gates, the nnobjective updates:

RACE 1:	FROM RACE START TO FIRST CHECKPOINT

As the first race begins, the spectators are all for Hovis and cheer him on. Similar to the announcer, these comms are almost background noise – enough to pick up, but not in the foreground of the audio mix.

DX_M06_0720_A-SPECTATOR
A-SPECTATOR
Go, Hovis! Go!

DX_M06_0730_C-SPECTATOR

RACE 1:	LAST QUARTER OF RACE

IF the player is trailing in the last quarter:

DX_M06_0240_DEXTER
DEXTER
Ha ha! My grandma is faster than you, Bretonian!

IF the player is in the lead in the last quarter of the race, two Borderworld fighters spawn and open fire on the player and the weapon platforms in the region go hostile.

DX_M06_0230_DEXTER
DEXTER
Damn! Give him something to think about, boys!

DX_M06_0260_DEXTER
DEXTER
Cease fire, boys!

DX_M06_0580_DEXTER
DEXTER
Trent, no hard feelings!

DX_M06_0590_DEXTER
DEXTER
Right?

(Trent lets Hovis dangle.)

If the player shoots a weapon platform or Borderworld fighter during this time:

DX_M06_0290_DEXTER
DEXTER
Stop attacking or the deal is off!

If the player destroys a weapon platform or Borderworld fighter:

DX_M06_0140_DEXTER
DEXTER
That's it, boy! Deal’s off!

(Player’s ship explodes.)

IF the player goes 30 seconds without passing through a gate during the race, he fails. If it is the first run, Dexter allows the player to race again. 

DX_M06_0180B_DEXTER
DEXTER
You've fallen so far behind that you'll never catch up.

BRANCH: FIRST FAILURE

IF it is the first run, Dexter allows the player to race again.

DX_M06_0540_DEXTER
DEXTER
You lose kid! Normally, I don’t do this, but I’ll give you another chance to prove yourself. Get back to that start point.

DX_M06_0260_DEXTER
DEXTER
Cease fire, boys!

IF Dexter was trailing in the last quarter of the first race:

DX_M06_0560_DEXTER
DEXTER
Don't worry about me. Worry about yourself.


The original race triggers and objectives activate, except that there is no status check in the last quarter of the race and comm 0190 does not play when the player hits the start point.

IF the player shoots a weapon platform or Borderworld fighter during this time:

DX_M06_0290_DEXTER
DEXTER
Stop attacking or the deal is off!

IF the player destroys a weapon platform or Borderworld fighter:

DX_M06_0140_DEXTER
DEXTER
That's it, boy! Deal’s off!

(Player’s ship explodes.)

BRANCH: SECOND FAILURE

If the player goes 30 seconds without passing through a ring in the second race, Dexter detonates the “bomb” on the player’s ship. This comm plays after comm 0180:

DX_M06_0620_DEXTER
DEXTER
That's too bad.


(Player’s ship explodes.)

MORE RACE ERROR CASES

If the player does not make positive progress toward the start point, this comm plays. 

DX_M06_0110B_DEXTER
DEXTER
You're trying my patience, boy!

(If the player continues to cut up, he fails with a string ID failure box.)

If the player jumps the gun, the objective updates to:

OBJECTIVE: LINE UP AT START WAYPOINT

In addition, Dexter reacts:

DX_M06_0120_DEXTER
DEXTER
What are you trying to do?!? Get back to the starting gate NOW!

When the player gets to the start point:

DX_M06_0130B_DEXTER
DEXTER
Okay, line up. No funny business.

If the player jumps the gun again:
DX_M06_0140_DEXTER
DEXTER
That's it, boy! Deal’s off!

(Player’s ship explodes.)

If the player bumps or shoots Dexter:

DX_M06_0280_DEXTER
DEXTER
WATCH IT!
(Growl, cautioning player to back off)

If the player bumps/shoots Dexter again:

DX_M06_0140_DEXTER
DEXTER
That's it, boy! Deal’s off!

(Player’s ship explodes.)

If the player arrives at the start point before the second race well before Dexter:

DX_M06_0630_DEXTER
DEXTER
Wait there. I’m getting into position.

When Hovis and the player get near the Hood:

DX_M06_0310_DEXTER
DEXTER
Ok, boy, you first.

SCENE:	S033X –INT. BATTLESHIP HOOD – LANDING DECK

After Trent has won the race against Dexter Hovis, the following scene automatically plays when Trent lands on the Bretonian Battleship “Hood” again. We see Trent’s ship landing on the large deck - Hovis awaits Trent as he lands. Hovis greets him.

DEXTER HOVIS
(Calling after him)
Hey Bretonian. If it don’t work out, you know you can always come back and race with us!

Trent takes off.

OBJECTIVE: TAKE trade lane to Glorious

The player is given a waypoint at the mouth of the exclusion zone to the Glorious, which is contains broken tradelane pieces that mark the route to the station. He is attacked by a random encounter of two to three Rheinland fighters en route to the Glorious.

On reaching the waypoint, the objective updates as above.

OBJECTIVE: Follow path of old tradelane to Glorious

When the player nears the Glorious, he spies four weak GMG ships (ge_fighter) near the station, which is surrounded by four Rheinland Heavy Fighters and a Rheinland Gunship.

Once the last GMG fighter has been destroyed! The Rheinlander fire torpedoes on the station. If the player does stop them, the Rheinlanders destroy the station and the mission fails.

The Glorious has been destroyed and Quintaine died with it. He was your only chance to ever solve the mystery of the artifact.

OBJECTIVE: LAND ON Glorious

SCENE:	S034X – INT. THE GLORIOUS – LANDING DECK

After Trent lands he steps out of his ship. A pirate appears behind him and puts a gun in his back. Trent puts his hands up and starts walking. They are met by a couple of other pirates who walk with them to a secluded area of the deck. There he's brought to an older, bald man, very fit, DR. ROLAND QUINTAINE. He is dressed in commando-style gear.

DX_S034X_1801_OR_PI_01.WAV
QUINTAINE PILOT 1
You fought well out there. C’mon, someone wants to have a look at you.

DX_S034X_1901_TRENT.WAV
TRENT
Whoa! Easy with that!

DX_S034X_2001_OR_PI_01.WAV
QUINTAINE PILOT 1
Right!

DX_S034X_0101_TRENT.WAV
TRENT
Doctor Quintaine.

DX_S034X_0201_QUINTAINE.WAV
QUINTAINE
And who are you?

DX_S034X_0301_TRENT.WAV
TRENT
The name’s Trent. Doctor Sinclair sent me to find you.

DX_S034X_0401_QUINTAINE.WAV
QUINTAINE
I find that hard to believe since she has no idea where I am.
(Firmer)
Now – who sent you?

DX_S034X_0501_TRENT.WAV
TRENT
I already told you.

DX_S034X_0601_QUINTAINE.WAV
QUINTAINE
Enough!

DX_S034X_0602_QUINTAINE.WAV
QUINTAINE
You do understand that with the appearance of our Rheinland friends, I’m hesitant to take too make chances.

DX_S034X_0701_TRENT.WAV
TRENT
But I fought them, too.

DX_S034X_0801_QUINTAINE.WAV
QUINTAINE
Yes, and I wanted to thank you for your help.
(To the pirates)
Push him out of the airlock!

Hands grab for him.
DX_S034X_0901_TRENT.WAV
TRENT
Wait. Wait! I have to Daam-K’Vosh artifact.

Quintaine’s hands shoots up – stop. The pirates fall silent at once as Quintaine takes a few steps forward.

DX_S034X_1001_QUINTAINE.WAV
QUINTAINE
(Quietly)
What did you say?

DX_S034X_1101_TRENT.WAV
TRENT
I have your artifact. The one Sinclair lost on Pygar. I’ve found it. That’s why I came.

This is unexpected. Quintaine turns his back, thinking and rubbing his bald head gently.

DX_S034X_1201_QUINTAINE.WAV
QUINTAINE
I don’t suspect you have it with you … no, that would be too easy.

DX_S034X_1202_QUINTAINE.WAV
QUINTAINE
So, where is it then?

DX_S034X_1301_TRENT.WAV
TRENT
Sinclair is working on it back on Leeds – in hiding. But she can’t decipher it on her own. She needs your help.

Quintaine studies his face.

DX_S034X_1401_QUINTAINE.WAV
QUINTAINE
Very well, Mr. Trent! I will go back with you, but on one condition.

DX_S034X_1501_TRENT.WAV
TRENT
What’s that?

DX_S034X_1601_QUINTAINE.WAV
QUINTAINE
That we not go alone.

DX_S034X_1701_TRENT.WAV
TRENT
Alright!

Quintaine extends his hand. Trent takes it and the others back off.

ANOTHER ANGLE:

Trent’s ship and two pirates take off as escort.

SCENE:	S027XA – INT. PLANET SPRAGUE – LANDING DECK

When the player launches from the Hood, he is hailed by Quintaine, who is flying an armored transport. Quintaine is right outside the Hood docking port, in formation with three civilian light fighters (civ4) that are equipped with a loadout that includes cruise disruptors.

DX_M06_0350_QUINTAINE
QUINTAINE
Mr. Trent, Quintaine here. I am flying this armored transport. I know it’s slow, but it contains all the equipment I need for my work.

DX_M06_0360_QUINTAINE
QUINTAINE
(Grumpy)
So Sinclair wants to meet on Leeds? That blight on our culture? Alright!
(ABeat)
Form up on me

OBJECTIVE: FOLLOW QUINTAINE

Once the player forms up, Quintaine leads the formation in cruise down the old tradelane path.

DX_M06_0360B_QUINTAINE
QUINTAINE
(Foreshadowing)
Keep your eyes open, there are bound to be more Rheinlanders out there.

When they reach a certain point in space, one Rheinland Gunship and three heavy fighters uncloak in front of them. They fire a cruise disruptor missile into Quintaine’s transport and the ships falls out of cruise. Note that Albertson is invulnerable for this battle. The Gunship and two Rheinland fighters concentrate their fire on Quintaine’s ship. The others engage the fighters.

DX_M06_0370_ALBERTSON
ALBERTSON
(Alert)
It’s an ambush!
DX_M06_0380_QUINTAINE
QUINTAINE
(Panicking)
I’m hit. My cruise engines are down!

DX_M06_0381_ALBERTSON
ALBERTSON
Trent, protect Quintaine. Perez and I will engage.

OBJECTIVE: PROTECT QUINTAINE

IF Rheinland Gunship is destroyed
DX_M06_0381_QUINTAINE
QUINTAINE
The Gunship is down.

IF first Rheinland fighter is destroyed

DX_M06_0382_ALBERTSON
ALBERTSON
We got one of their fighters.

IF second Rheinland fighter is destroyed

DX_M06_0383_ALBERTSON
ALBERTSON
One down! One to go!

IF last Rheinland fighter is destroyed

DX_M06_0384_ALBERTSON
ALBERTSON
The last fighter is down!

Once all enemies are destroyed:

DX_M06_0385_ALBERTSON
ALBERTSON
That was close!

DX_M06_0600_QUINTAINE
QUINTAINE
My cruise engines are back online. We have to get out of here.

On reaching a point well into open space, clear of enemy pursuit:

DX_M06_0390_QUINTAINE
QUINTAINE
Albertson, where are we going?

DX_M06_1260_ALBERTSON
ALBERTSON
I think we’re in luck. The intermittent Jump Hole to Leeds is phase-aligned right now. We should be able safely to take it. I’m uploading the coordinates.

OBJECTIVE: GO TO JUMP HOLE

A hostile appears within 2000 m. The incoming Rheinland light fighter darts toward Quintaine. He is story-invulnerable (takes damage only up to 90%).

DX_M06_1270_QUINTAINE
QUINTAINE
Hopefully, that was the last of them.

DX_M06_1271_ALBERTSON
ALBERTSON
I’m picking up something on the radar … closing fast!
(A beat - alerted)
It’s another Rheinlander!

Quintaine breaks formation and Albertson engages.

DX_M06_1290_ALBERTSON
ALBERTSON
Run, Quintaine! We'll try to slow him down.

Quintaine puts his ship into cruise, heading for the Jump Hole. If there is time in this space, these two comms also play in the sequence:

DX_M06_1280_QUINTAINE
QUINTAINE
I knew we wouldn't get away that easy.

The Rheinland ship targets Quintaine and follows his ship.

DX_M06_1300_ALBERTSON
ALBETSON
He’s after Quintaine!

OBJECTIVE: destroy RHEINLAND SHIP

When the Rheinlander tagger gets within 600 m of Quintaine, he stops for a moment and then slams into cruise, heading for the Jump Hole to Leeds. The tagger also stops at ranges of 2000m and 300m from the Jump Hole. He cruises most of the way, but uses normal engines for the last 2000m.

Quintaine drops out of cruise momentarily, confused. Albertson pursues. Quintaine’s mission-marked status is revoked; the tagger is the only arrow on the virtual radar.

DX_M06_1310_QUINTAINE
QUINTAINE
(Alarm sfx)
What's happening?!?

DX_M06_1320_ALBERTSON
ALBERTSON
He tagged your ship! We have to stop him before he gets to the Jump Hole!

DX_M06_1330_QUINTAINE
QUINTAINE
Why?

DX_M06_1340_ALBERTSON
ALBERTSON
Signal strength! Tracking units can't calibrate at short range. But if he jumps out, he'll be able to pinpoint you anywhere!

If the tagger gets within 4000 m of the Jump Hole:

DX_M06_1350_ALBERTSON
ALBERTSON
He's getting close to the Jump Hole! We have to stop him!


If the tagger gets within 1700m of the Jump Hole:

DX_M06_1370_QUINTAINE
QUINTAINE
We’re out of time! He's at the Jump Hole! Fire! Fire!

If the tagger jumps out:

DX_M06_1390_QUINTAINE
QUINTAINE
He's gone. I'm as good as dead.

(Fail dialog.)

If we deem this encounter too difficult, the tagger develops “technical difficulties”:

DX_M06_1450_ALBERTSON
ALBERTSON
Looks like he's got engine problems! Shoot him down!


OBJECTIVE: take jump hole to leeds

If the tagger dies:

DX_M06_1400_QUINTAINE
QUINTAINE
You got him! 

DX_M06_1410_ALBERTSON
ALBERTSON
Great. Let's get out of here.

When the player reaches the Jump Hole:

DX_M06_1420_QUINTAINE
QUINTAINE
Mr. Trent, you dock first and we'll follow you through.

The distances here are short; there is no need for guide behavior. If the player does not proceed to the Jump Hole in a timely fashion, we have a warning and fail comm:

DX_M06_1460_ALBERTSON
ALBERTSON
Trent, where are you going? Quintaine is at the Jump Hole. I'm not going to chase you.

DX_M06_1470_ALBERTSON
ALBERTSON
Quintaine, let's lose this jerk. He's got a death wish.

Originally, there were two ships to make things more difficult: one tagger and one heavy fighter running interference. There is also the possibility of spawning more Rheinland hostiles from the Jump Hole as the player nears it. In the interests of preserving flexibility, these are the comms that support those options.

DX_M06_1380_ALBERTSON
ALBERTSON
Oh no… he's already docking!


When two extra ships appear form the Jump Hole and help the tagger:

DX_M06_1382_ALBERTSON
ALBERTSON
Damn! He sent for help! We can’t let these guys get out here alive!



DX_M06_1430_ALBERTSON
ALBERTSON
That's one down. Get the tagger!

DX_M06_1440_ALBERTSON
ALBERTSON
Now let's hunt his buddy and we can get the hell out of here.

DX_M06_1510_QUINTAINE
QUINTAINE
Someone's jumping in. (beat) More Rheinland fighters

DX_M06_1515_ALBERTSON
ALBERTSON
One more…

DX_M06_1520_ALBERTSON
ALBERTSON
Cover Quintaine! He's helpless!

DX_M06_1530_QUINTAINE
QUINTAINE
(Concentrating)
Albertson, can you not find more considerate ways to say that?

Comms 1400 and 1410 would provide the endcap for this encounter in any case.

On reaching the Leeds system, the objective updates. The party is in a fog field that is several thousand meters galactic-west of Planet Leeds but only a few hundred meters from a tradelane. Quintaine spawns a formation, conscripting Albertson, and super guides the player through the tradelane toward Planet Leeds.

DX_M06_1480_ALBERTSON
ALBERTSON
We'll be at Planet Leeds before you know it, Professor.

DX_M06_0510_QUINTAINE
QUINTAINE
We should be safe now. Let's get back on solid ground.

DX_M06_1490_QUINTAINE
QUINTAINE
Follow me.

DX_M06_1491_ALBERTSON
ALBERTSON
Trent, you have the coordinates to Leeds. Take point.

OBJECTIVE: MEET JUNI AND TOBIAS oN Leeds

After the party enters the Trade Lane in relative calm, Quintaine speaks:

DX_M06_0430_QUINTAINE
QUINTAINE
I actually haven’t seen Dr. Sinclair in years. She sent me a message a while back that she had made a discovery on Pygar. Finally, a Daam-K’Vosh artifact that’s still active…

DX_M06_0440_QUINTAINE
QUINTAINE
I can’t wait to see it.

When the party arrives at Planet Leeds:

DX_M06_0530_QUINTAINE
QUINTAINE
I’ll meet you down on the planet, Mr. Trent. You go first.

OBJECTIVE: LAND ON LEEDS

SCENE:	S037A – OFFER – INT. PLANET LEEDS – EQUIPMENT ROOM

When they enter the Equipment Room in Leeds, Trent and Quintaine find Tobias just finishing a transaction. He sees them on the far side of the room and escorts the other pilot to the door.

DX_S037A_0101_TOBIAS.WAV
TOBIAS
Wonderful doing business with you. Good night.

Tobias turns to face Trent and Quintaine. He looks Quintaine up and down.

DX_S037A_0201_TOBIAS.WAV
TOBIAS
Here, who’s this then?

DX_S037A_0301_TRENT.WAV
TRENT
This is Dr. Quintaine. He’s a professor.

DX_S037A_0401_TOBIAS.WAV
TOBIAS
Him? No … what field?

DX_S037A_0501_QUINTAINE.WAV
QUINTAINE
I’ll have you know, Sir, I am the foremost authority on Xeno-Archeology.

DX_S037A_0601_TOBIAS.WAV
TOBIAS
(Tobias stifles laughter)
Oh, I’m sure you are.

DX_S037A_0602_TOBIAS.WAV
TOBIAS (CONT’D)
(Laughs , then jovially)
Hahahaha! Come on, Mr. Wizard. I expect you’ve come to see the missus.

SCENE:	S037AB – INT. PLANET LEEDS – EQUIPMENT ROOM – ANTE ROOM

A moment later in the ante room/dead storage environment of the Leeds Equipment Room: The camera is tight on Sinclair. She looks up.

DX_S037A_0701_SINCLAIR.WAV
SINCLAIR
Quintaine!

Sinclair runs up to Quintaine, happy to see him. Juni comes up to Trent. We stay with them as Quintaine and Sinclair continue to rumble amongst themselves.

DX_S037A_0801_JUNI.WAV
JUNI
So, that’s him, huh?

DX_S037A_0901_TRENT.WAV
TRENT
Uh-huh … and let me tell you he’s a tough old bird. He nearly pushed me out of an airlock.

DX_S037A_1001_JUNI.WAV
JUNI
Hm! It’s a pity he didn’t succeed!

He looks at her … she breaks into a smile. Suddenly…

DX_S037A_1101_SINCLAIR.WAV
SINCLAIR
(Angry)
Dammit, I am made as hell at you. What happened? Where have you been?

DX_S037A_1201_QUINTAINE.WAV
QUINTAINE
(A moment – then finally)
I had to go away, Kendra.

DX_S037A_1202_QUINTAINE.WAV
QUINTAINE
Not long after your discovery, things began to happen.

DX_S037A_1203_QUINTAINE.WAV
QUINTAINE
People around me started to go missing … then I came back one night to find my lab turned upside down and …

DX_S037A_1204_QUINTAINE.WAV
QUINTAINE
Noticed I was being followed.

DX_S037A_1301_SINCLAIR.WAV
SINCLAIR
By whom?

DX_S037A_1401_QUINTAINE.WAV
QUINTAINE
A man named Kress. He told me I was on a list, that my work had put me in great jeopardy.

DX_S037A_1402_QUINTAINE.WAV
QUINTAINE
I left that night and didn’t look back. So you see, I couldn’t tell anyone…

DX_S037A_1403_QUINTAINE.WAV
QUINTAINE
Especially you! I thought you’d become a target as well.

DX_S037A_1501_JUNI.WAV
JUNI
She already is. We all are. Because of this!

She holds up the artifact.
ANGLE ON: The artifact gleaming in the foreground and Quintaine’s expression of wonder. He walks up, still in awe.

DX_S037A_1601_QUINTAINE.WAV
QUINTAINE
This is it? May I?

Quintaine takes the artifact from Juni.

DX_S037A_1602_QUINTAINE.WAV
QUINTAINE
It’s magnificent!

DX_S037A_1701_SINCLAIR.WAV
SINCLAIR
Yes, it is … but it’s obviously part of something more significant.

DX_S037A_1702_SINCLAIR.WAV
SINCLAIR
It’s time you and I figured out what that is.

DX_S037A_1801_TRENT.WAV
TRENT
Look, I hate to rush this reunion along…

A SMALL ALARM SOUND beeps – and a RED LED glows on Tobias’ wrist, cutting off Trent. Tobias looks down at it.

DX_S037A_1901_TOBIAS.WAV
TOBIAS
Someone’s here. I’ll take care of it.

SCENE:	S037AC – INT. PLANET LEEDS – EQUIPMENT ROOM

A moment later in the Equipment Room: Tobias walks from dead storage O.S. and sees TWO RHEINLAND AGENTS, thin and creepy, standing in the Equipment Room. They are looking around – taking in too much detail. Though they try to blend in they stick out like sore thumbs.

DX_S037A_2001_TOBIAS.WAV
TOBIAS
(Clapping his hands together)
Hello, my friends. What is it I can get for you today?

DX_S037A_2101_RH_AGENT01.WAV
RHEINLAND AGENT #1
We’re looking for a man. We have reason to believe he’s in the area.

Agent #2 shows Tobias a scan-pic of Quintaine.

DX_S037A_2201_TOBIAS.WAV
TOBIAS
Nice looking chap. Sorry, haven’t seen him.

DX_S037A_2301_RH_AGENT01.WAV
RHEINLAND AGENT #1
He is considered an enemy of Rheinland.

DX_S037A_2302_RH_AGENT01.WAV
RHEINLAND AGENT #1
Anyone caught hiding him would face severe consequences.

DX_S037A_2401_TOBIAS.WAV
TOBIAS
(Darkly)
Listen to me. You’re not in Rheinland now, you’re in my shop.

DX_S037A_2402_TOBIAS.WAV
TOBIAS
I already told you the man you’re looking for isn’t here. So unless you’d like an education in foreign policy…

DX_S037A_2403_TOBIAS.WAV
TOBIAS
That you won’t soon forget, I suggest you move along. Now!

Rheinland Agent #1 locks eyes with Tobias. He then backs off and motions to #2 to do the same.

DX_S037A_2501_RH_AGENT01.WAV
RHEINLAND AGENT #1
We can be patient, Mr. Tobias. Rest assured we won’t be far.

He and the other agent walk away, leaving Tobias alone.

DX_S037A_2601_TOBIAS.WAV
TOBIAS
(To himself)
No, I’m sure you won’t be.

Tobias turns to see the others having now come out of hiding.

DX_S037A_2701_JUNI.WAV
JUNI
It’s just a matter of time before they’ll be back.

DX_S037A_2801_TOBIAS.WAV
TOBIAS
She’s right. Now that they’ve got your scent, it’s not safe here anymore.

DX_S037A_2901_QUINTAINE.WAV
QUINTAINE
(Has an idea)
Kress!

They all turn.

DX_S037A_3001_QUINTAINE.WAV
QUINTAINE
(He’s still mulling this over)
The night he came he offered me a place to hide in the Border Worlds. Maybe now is a good time to take him up on it.

DX_S037A_3101_JUNI.WAV
JUNI
(Pointedly)
But do you trust him?

X_S037A_3201_QUINTAINE.WAV
QUINTAINE
I’d rather take my chances with him than those Rheinland Agents.

DX_S037A_3301_JUNI.WAV
JUNI
We need you now, Trent. Ready?

The MISSION OFFER PANEL appears with more detailed information concerning the mission and offering the player the choices to ACCEPT or DECLINE the mission.

The Offer Panel comes up:

FIND KRESS

Objective:	You have to hide from the Rheinland agents. Fly with Juni, Sinclair and Quintaine to the Border Worlds and find the base of the mysterious Kress.
Difficulty:	The Rheinland agents will be trying to stop you from reaching the Border Worlds. They will likely hunt you the entire way. It’s very advisable to fly a powerful combat vessel.
Reward:		This is not about money it’s about survival.

SCENE:	S037B – ACCEPT – INT. PLANET LEEDS – EQUIPMENT ROOM

DX_S037B_0101_TRENT.WAV
TRENT
(Decisive)
Alright. Let’s go!

The others start to exit frame. Trent stays behind and speaks to Tobias.

DX_S037B_0201_TRENT.WAV
TRENT
Now I want you to get clear of this place for a while.

DX_S037B_0301_TOBIAS.WAV
TOBIAS
(Starts to object)
I’m not gonna be …

DX_S037B_0401_TRENT.WAV
TRENT
Just until this blows over! I’ll be back when I can.

Tobias takes this in. Finally, he nods.

DX_S037B_0501_TRENT.WAV
TRENT
Take care of yourself, Old Man.

They clasp both hands out of frame, saying goodbye. Trent leaves with the others as Tobias watches him go. The scene ends on the Leeds Cityscape.

OBJECTIVE: LAUNCH TO SPACE

SCENE:	S037C – DECLINE – INT. PLANET LEEDS – EQUIPMENT ROOM

DX_S037C_0101_TRENT.WAV
TRENT
I’m not ready to go.

They turn to Trent.

DX_S037C_0201_JUNI.WAV
JUNI
What?

DX_S037C_0301_TOBIAS.WAV
TOBIAS
Trent, you can’t stay here.

DX_S037C_0401_JUNI.WAV
JUNI
And we’re not going without you!

DX_S037C_0501_QUINTAINE.WAV
QUINTAINE
The hell we’re not. It’s suicide to stay.

DX_S037C_0601_JUNI.WAV
JUNI
(Decisively)
We’re not leaving without him.
(To Trent)
I hope you know what you’re doing.

Quintaine is in a huff, the tension is thick.

DX_S037C_0701_TRENT.WAV
TRENT
I do.

He exits frame. Juni watches him go.

SCENE:	S037D – REOFFER – INT. PLANET LEEDS – EQUIPMENT ROOM

Trent returns to find everyone where he left them.

DX_S037D_0101_QUINTAINE.WAV
QUINTAINE
(A little mad still)
Well, it’s about damn time!

DX_S037D_0201_JUNI.WAV
JUNI
You’re back!

DX_S037D_0301_TRENT.WAV
TRENT
I am.

DX_S037D_0401_JUNI.WAV
JUNI
(Nodding – pleased)
What do you say we find this Kress and get the hell out of here?

After the scene has finished, the MISSION OFFER PANEL appears with more detailed information concerning the mission and offering choices to ACCEPT or DECLINE the mission.

SCENE:	SPACE RTC 15: START: LAUNCH FROM LEEDS

Standard launch sequence. When Trent emerges from the Docking Ring above Leeds, he’s welcome by Juni, Sinclair (who is flying a Bretonia Freighter) and Quintaine (who is still flying his armored transport).

DX_M07_0100_JUNI
JUNI
(Ready for action – slightly impatient)
There you are! Trent, do you think Tobias will be alright? Maybe he should come with us.

DX_M07_0110_TRENT
TRENT
Tobias is better off far away from us. As long as we have the artifact, none of us will be safe. We’ll be lucky to get out of here in one piece…

SCENE:	SPACE RTC 15: END: LAUNCH FROM LEEDS

DX_M07_0120_JUNI
JUNI
We should take the Trade Lane to Stokes and from there we’ll jump to the Tau-31 System.

DX_M07_0130_QUINTAINE
QUINTAINE
We don’t have any time to waste. Let’s go!

OBJECTIVE: TAKE TRADE LANE TO STOKES

As the ships approach the Trade Lane, two Rheinland Heavy Fighters uncloak right next to the entrance – these are the two Rheinland agents our heroes just me on Leeds. They send a chilling comm. (note that these characters had a German accent in the previous Base RTC scene):

DX_M07_0140_JUNI
JUNI
There! Rheinlanders!

The Trade Lane is locked for this portion of the mission until the combat is over. Agent 1 is invulnerable in this segment.

DX_M07_0150_RH_AGENT_01
RHEINLAND AGENT #1
(Threatening)
We told you we wouldn’t be far. Give up the artifact … all exits out of this system are blocked. You cannot get out!

DX_M07_0160_JUNI
JUNI
We’ll see about that!

Juni attacks:

OBJECTIVE: ENGAGE RHEINLAND FIGHTERS

DX_M07_0170_RH_AGENT_01
RHEINLAND AGENT #1
(Threatening)
As you wish!

After a fairly short battle, Juni or Trent destroy the first of the Rheinlanders.

DX_M07_0180_RH_AGENT_01
RHEINLAND AGENT #1
(Threatening)
We’ll meet again. You’ll never make it out of Bretonia alive!

The moment that happens, the other one sends a comm. and cloak.

DX_M07_0190_SINCLAIR
SINCLAIR
(Frustrated)
Dammit! He cloaked! We’ve got to get away from here… 

OBJECTIVE: TAKE TRADE LANE TO STOKES

DX_M07_0200_JUNI
JUNI
Take the Trade Lane. Trent, you go first. I’ll cover the rear.

Once the player enters the Trade Lane:

DX_M07_0210_QUINTAINE
QUINTAINE
(Puzzled and angry)
I cannot believe they continue to attack us in the middle of Bretonia territory.

DX_M07_0220_JUNI
JUNI
(Surprised at this ignorance of current events)
Where have you been, Professor? The colonies are at the brink of war. Rheinland ships have been sighted in just about every system.

DX_M07_0230_SINCLAIR
SINCLAIR
(Worried)
That Rheinlander said that all exits out of Leeds are blocked. What do we do?

DX_M07_0240_JUNI
JUNI
(Determined)
We fight.

DX_M07_0250_JUNI
JUNI
(Tense)
We’re coming up on Stokes. Stay sharp!

The three ships emerge from the Trade Lane near Stokes.

DX_M07_0260_STOKES
STOKES SMELTER
(Tense)
…are in violation of the Boorman Treaty. Leave this area at once!

DX_M07_0270_RH_AGENT_01
RHEINLAND AGENT #1
(Threatening)
Stay out of this. We’re here on direct orders from the Chancellor. 

Four Rheinland ships fly toward Trent, Juni and the others.

DX_M07_0280_JUNI
JUNI
(Tense)
We’ve got incoming! Trent, keep them away from Sinclair and Quintaine.

DX_M07_0290_RH_AGENT_01
RHEINLAND AGENT #1

(To Stokes)
Negative, Stokes! There’s no time.
(To Trent, Sinclair & Quintaine)
We have to get out of Leeds. Trent, take the Trade Lane.

Let’s hope the Jump Gate is clear. It’s the only way out of Leeds.

DX_M07_0400_JUNI
JUNI
(Determined)
Trent, Sinclair and Quintaine need enough time to get through the Gate. No matter what awaits us at there – we have to buy them as much time as we can and then jump to Tau-31.

As they approach the end of the Trade Lane. Random pop has been turned off for this entire sequence.

(Alarmed)
Oh my God! A Rheinlander Cruiser is blocking the Gate! We don’t stand a chance!

When they emerge from the Trade Lane, it’s obvious that they’re totally outgunned. One Rheinland Cruiser (Donau-Class) and several Heavy Fighters are blocking the Jump Gate.

Damn! It seems that our transmissions are being blocked!

Suddenly, a wing of three ships comes through the Trade Lane. One Civilian Very Heavy Fighter and two Civilian Heavy Fighters:

DX_M07_0480_TOBIAS
TOBIAS
(Determined)
Open fire, chaps. We have to take out that Cruiser!

DX_M07_0490_JUNI

You did it!

DX_M07_0510_TOBIAS
TOBIAS
(Determined)
Trent, a fleet of Rheinland ships is only minutes behind us. We have little time. Destroy the fighters and let’s get out of here!

Tobias and his wing help to destroy the remaining Rheinland Heavy Fighters. Once the last one is destroyed, the following comm. plays.

DX_M07_0520_GLASGOW

The Bretonia Military has been alerted. They will be here soon. Good luck, Glasgow.
(A beat)
Go, Trent! Activate the Jump Gate. I’ll see you on the other side.

IF the player does not take the Jump Gate within 30 seconds, two wings of Rheinland fighters arrives from the tradelane and attacks.

Trent, take point. We’ll follow you.

OBJECTIVE: TAKE TRADE LANE TO OUTPOST HOLMAN

Once everybody is in the Trade Lane:

DX_M07_0600_TOBIAS
TOBIAS
(Business-like)
We’re heading toward the IMG Outpost Holman …it’s the only base in this entire system. Where were you planning to go?

DX_M07_0610_QUINTAINE
QUINTAINE
The night I met Kress, he told me that if I wanted to find him, I should talk to the bartender on Shinkaku. Is that a planet?

DX_M07_0620_TOBIAS
TOBIAS
(Intrigued)
That’s a Samura station. It was built right next to the large methane field in Tau-29. A bit remote, but not too far from here!

DX_M07_0630_TOBIAS
TOBIAS
We’re coming up on Holman. Keep your eyes open. If there are Rheinlanders, we won’t have the element of surprise this time.

The group exits the tradelane at Holman. Everything seems calm.

DX_M07_0640_JUNI
JUNI
(Cautiously optimistic)
Radar is clear! Looks like we managed to shake them!

DX_M07_0650_TOBIAS
TOBIAS
The next Trade Lane takes us to the Tau-29 gate – from there, it’s just a short flight to Shinkaku.

OBJECTIVE: TAKE TRADE LANE TO TAU-29 GATE

The group flies toward the Trade Lane entrance.

DX_M07_0660_JUNI
JUNI
(Cautious)
It’s strange that there are no ships around here.
(To Holman)
Outpost Holman? Please come in…

The Outpost stays quiet for a few seconds.

DX_M07_0670_JUNI
JUNI
(Alerted)
Something is very wrong here!

Suddenly, a massive RHEINLAND BATTLESHIP uncloaks directly in front of the Trade Lane. Off screen, Rheinland Gunships and Heavy Fighters uncloak behind the group.

DX_M07_0680_TOBIAS
TOBIAS
It’s a trap! We only have one chance … quick after me.

When the Battleship takes out one of the two Civilian Heavy Fighters:

DX_M07_0690_TOBIAS
TOBIAS
No!
(Deep groan)
It was not his fight.

DX_M07_0710_TOBIAS_FRIEND
TOBIAS FRIEND
(Serious)
Tobias, we will hold them off. Get these people to safety. Run!

OBJECTIVE: FOLLOW TOBIAS

They all follow Tobias into a Trade Lane that seems to be under construction. They’re taking heavy fire, but the Gunships and the Battleship don’t pursue them into the ice crystal field.

DX_M07_0700_TOBIAS
TOBIAS
This is the Trade Lane to the new Tau-23 Gate. It’s under construction on this end, but we should be able to use it.

As they flee, the second Civilian Heavy Fighter is destroyed.

DX_M07_0710_TOBIAS
TOBIAS
(Somber)
Thank you, my friends…

After they pass two non-finished rings, the Trade Lane is functional. The whole way, they’re being pursued by Rheinland Heavy Fighters.

DX_M07_0780_TOBIAS
TOBIAS
(Determined)
The Lane should be usable from here on. Everybody, into the Trade Lane! Quick!

OBJECTIVE: TAKE TRADE LANE TO TAU-23 GATE

The group takes the Trade Lane toward the unfinished Tau-23 Gate. Several Rheinland fighters are right behind them.

DX_M07_0790_JUNI

(Near panic)
What’s our plan?

DX_M07_0800_TOBIAS
TOBIAS
(Grim)
The Tau-23 gate is not functional yet. Our best option is Planet Harris … but it’s pretty far from here.

DX_M07_0810_QUINTAINE
QUINTAINE
(Alarmed)
Not functional? You mean this is a dead end?!?

Suddenly, the Trade Lane is disrupted.

DX_M07_0820_JUNI

They’ve disrupted the Trade Lane!

DX_M07_0830_SINCLAIR
SINCLAIR
There! Mre Rheinland Gunships!

DX_M07_0840_TOBIAS
TOBIAS
(Grim)
We cannot make it to Planet Harris from here… but there’s an intermittent Jump Hole nearby. It might not work, but it’s our only option. I’m uploading the coordinates!

The Gunships open fire.

DX_M07_0850_TOBIAS
TOBIAS
(Grim)
We need to buy them some time! Trent, you and I will stay here and fight the Gunships. Everybody else … get to that Jump Hole and wait for us there.

IF Trent runs away

DX_M07_0855_TOBIAS
TOBIAS
(Grim)
Trent, where are you going? You have to stay here and fight!

DX_M07_0860_QUINTAINE
QUINTAINE
Understood! Good luck!

OBJECTIVE: ENGAGE RHEINLAND GUNSHIPS

Sinclair, Quintaine and Juni fly toward the Jump Hole. Tobias and Trent stay to fight the Gunships and to buy the others time to get away.

DX_M07_0870_TOBIAS
TOBIAS
(Grim but determined)
Alright, Trent! It’s you and I against two Gunships! Let’s see how much you’ve learned since you left Leeds!

Tobias engages the two large ships.

DX_M07_0880_TOBIAS
TOBIAS
Target their engines! That’s their weakest spot!

When the others are at the Jump Hole.

DX_M07_0890_TOBIAS
TOBIAS
Trent, that’s enough. The others should be at the Jump Hole. Let’s get out of here!

IF either of the pair manages to destroy a gunship:

DX_M07_0900_TOBIAS
TOBIAS
(Bloodthirsty glee – throaty laugh)
We’re not such easy prey after all, eh!

OBJECTIVE: FLY TO JUMP HOLE

Tobias flies toward the Jump Hole. The Rheinland ships don’t follow them.

DX_M07_0910_TOBIAS
TOBIAS
They’re not following us! Hopefully, the Jump Hole will be phase aligned. If not, we’re in big trouble.

IF the player scored 30 or more hits on the two Gunships:

DX_M07_0920_TOBIAS
TOBIAS
(Proud)
You did well back there, boy! I’m proud of you.

IF the player scored less than 30 hits on the two Gunships:

DX_M07_0930_TOBIAS
TOBIAS
(Joking)
You’re getting soft in your old age, boy! I expected you to make more of a dent in that fight.

After a few more seconds of flight the duo reaches a range trigger around the Jump Hole. Juni forms up on them – the three ships continue to fly toward the Jump Hole.

DX_M07_0940_JUNI
JUNI
(Relieved
There you are! We were about to turn around and look for you. Are you being followed?

DX_M07_0950_TOBIAS
TOBIAS
(Curious)
No! They didn’t follow us into the field. Very curious!
(A beat)
No matter. We have to leave the system. What‘s the status of the Jump Hole?

DX_M07_0960_JUNI
JUNI
(Serious
I’ve taken some readings. It seems to be phase-aligned. We should be able to use it.

They reach the Jump Hole. Quintaine and Sinclair are waiting there.

TOBIAS
(Impatient)
Good! What are we waiting for? Let’s go!
(A beat)
Trent, you go first – I will make sure that no Rheinlanders are following us!

OBJECTIVE: TAKE JUMP GATE TO TAU-29 SYSTEM

Everybody arrives in the Tau-29 system. Tobias comes in last.

DX_M07_0980_TOBIAS
TOBIAS
(Curious)
There’s no sign of them, but I’m sure they’ll be back. We need to keep moving … follow me. Shinkaku is not far…

DX_M07_0985_JUNI
JUNI
Shinkaku is not far, Trent. Take point!

DX_M07_0986_JUNI
JUNI
We’re near Shinkaku station, Trent. I’ve uploaded the coordinates. Take the lead.

OBJECTIVE: GO TO SHINKAKU STATION

Once they’re all en route to Shinkaku

DX_M07_0990_QUINTAINE
QUINTAINE
Once again, we’re in your debt, Mr. Tobias.

DX_M07_1000_TOBIAS
TOBIAS
If Rheinland keeps openly attacking targets in Bretonia, it could easily lead to a full scale war.

DX_M07_1010_SINCLAIR
SINCLAIR
I don’t understand … do you think all of this is happening because of the artifact?

DX_M07_1020_QUINTAINE
QUINTAINE
It could be. We need to find a safe haven and perform a thorough analysis of the object.

DX_M07_1030_TOBIAS
TOBIAS
We’re almost at Shinkaku. 

DX_M07_1040_JUNI
JUNI
Hard to believe it all hinges on a message to some bartender. I hope this Kress wasn’t playing games… or setting a trap.

They reach the area of the Samura station Shinkaku.

DX_M07_1050_QUINTAINE
QUINTAINE
I will land and talk to the bartender.

DX_M07_1060_JUNI
JUNI
We should all land to make repairs and rearm ourselves. Trent, you go first … 

OBJECTIVE: DOCK WITH STATION

The player can now do whatever he/she wants to – listen the news and rumors, purchase equipment or ammo. Once he/she launches back to space, everybody will be assembled.

DX_M07_1070_JUNI
JUNI
Guess what? There actually was a message for Quintaine.

DX_M07_1080_QUINTAINE
QUINTAINE
Apparently, the Kress base is not far – it’s in a secret location on the far side of this system. The bartender gave me a set of coordinates. I’m uploading them now.

DX_M07_1090_TOBIAS
TOBIAS
My friends, I will take my leave from you now. If there is indeed a war coming between Rheinland and Bretonia, I am needed at home.

DX_M07_1100_JUNI
JUNI
I understand. Thank you for everything, Tobias.

DX_M07_1110_TOBIAS
TOBIAS
We will meet again, I promise. Trent, get these people to safety and find out what this artifact of yours is all about.
(A beat)
Good luck to all of you!

With these words, Tobias flies off.

DX_M07_1120_JUNI
JUNI
Alright everybody, let’s get moving.

Juni flies off.

OBJECTIVE: FLY TO WAYPOINT

DX_M07_1130_QUINTAINE
QUINTAINE
We have to be careful. The bartender warned me that Rheinland ships have been sighted in the area. He suggested that we fly through the methane field – it should mask our engine signatures.

DX_M07_1140_JUNI
JUNI
Be careful in the methane field. Certain pockets are explosive and could damage our ships.

DX_M07_1150_SINCLAIR
SINCLAIR
What did the bartender say about Kress?

DX_M07_1160_QUINTAINE
QUINTAINE
Not much. He told me that Kress frequently operates in this area and then he gave me these coordinates. That’s all.

DX_M07_1170_QUINTAINE
QUINTAINE
Unfortunately, the field will only provide us with cover for half of the way. After that, we’ll have to fly through open space.

When the group reaches the end of the methane field:

DX_M07_1180_QUINTAINE
QUINTAINE
We’re at the edge of the field. From now on, we’re without cover.

DX_M07_1190_JUNI
JUNI
In case we run into Rheinland ships, use your cruise engines or your afterburners to get to the Oxygen field on the far side of the system. We’ll regroup there.

Juni, maybe you and Sinclair should stay with the ships.

DX_S038X_0201_JUNI.WAV
JUNI
Why?

DX_S038X_0301_TRENT.WAV
TRENT
It might be dangerous.

DX_S038X_0401_JUNI.WAV
JUNI
Oh, like everything else hasn’t been?

DX_S038X_0501_QUINTAINE.WAV
QUINTAINE
Quiet you two. We just need to find Kress.

They walk to a doorway, where a wall of human flesh suddenly blocks their path – a very big man, BIG MAN #1.

DX_S038X_0601_BIG_MAN_01.WAV
BIG MAN #1
State your business.

DX_S038X_0701_QUINTAINE.WAV
QUINTAINE
My name is Quintaine. I’m here to see Kress.

DX_S038X_0801_BIG_MAN_01.WAV
BIG MAN #1
Colonel Kress sees no one.

DX_S038X_0901_QUINTAINE.WAV
QUINTAINE
He’ll see me.

DX_S038X_1001_BIG_MAN_01.WAV
BIG MAN #1
He sees no one.

Quintaine tries to force his way through. The Big Man reaches for his gun.
CLOSE on the Big Man. The sound of a blaster charging; the camera pulls out to reveal Trent’s gun firmly planted under the Big Man’s chin.

DX_S038X_1101_TRENT.WAV
TRENT
Don’t go and do that.

DX_S038X_1201_JUNI.WAV
JUNI
(Astonished)
Trent, what are you doing?

Trent nudges the gun under the Big Man’s chin. The Big Man takes his hand off of his gun. Everyone else is frozen.

DX_S038X_1301_TRENT.WAV
TRENT
Now that I got your attention, take us to see the Colonel.

DX_S038X_1401_BIG_MAN_01.WAV
BIG MAN #1
I think, my friend, you misunderstand your position.

Tight on Trent: The sound of several more blasters charging; camera pulls out to reveal several other pirates surround them – now having drawn their weapons. It’s almost silly.

DX_S038X_1501_BIG_MAN_01.WAV
BIG MAN #1
I’m expendable.

A tense moment! Then…

DX_S038X_1601_KRESS.WAV
KRESS (O.S.)
Wait a moment!

Two pirates step aside to let ANTON KRESS, thirty – if that, their leader, through. They relax their aim. He sees Quintaine and recognizes him.

DX_S038X_1701_KRESS.WAV
KRESS
Dr. Quintaine. I’m pleased to see that you’re alright after all.

He looks at Trent.

DX_S038X_1801_KRESS.WAV
KRESS
And you brought protection. Very wise! Please tell him to stand down.

DX_S038X_1901_QUINTAINE.WAV
QUINTAINE
(To Trent)
Mr. Trent.

Trent backs off and holsters his weapon. Kress waves his hand and the pirates do the same.

DX_S038X_2001_KRESS.WAV
KRESS
Come, Dr. Quintaine, we have much to talk about. You and your friends are welcome guests at my table.

Kress takes Quintaine and Dr. Sinclair through the door. As Trent and Juni follow, she speaks quietly to him.

DX_S038X_2101_JUNI.WAV
JUNI
(Sarcastic)
Hey, thanks for keeping me out of danger. Unbelievable!

DX_S038X_2201_TRENT.WAV
TRENT
What?

They walk out of frame.

SCENE:	S038B –INT. CALI BASE – BAR

They are sitting around Kress’ table, drinks are all around.

DX_S038X_2301_KRESS.WAV
KRESS
And so now you are finally here, Doctor, let me offer you the sanctuary and hospitality of my base.

DX_S038X_2401_QUINTAINE.WAV
QUINTAINE
Thank you! We’ll need a place to continue our research.

DX_S038X_2501_KRESS.WAV
KRESS
We have facilities at your disposal, of course.

DX_S038X_2601_TRENT.WAV
TRENT
Now, I’m sorry … maybe it’s because people have been shooting at me everywhere I’ve gone.

DX_S038X_2602_TRENT.WAV
TRENT
But why should you care what happens to us?

DX_S038X_2701_QUINTAINE.WAV
QUINTAINE
Mr. Trent.

DX_S038X_2801_KRESS.WAV
KRESS
No, he’s quite right, Doctor, you deserve an explanation.

DX_S038X_2802_KRESS.WAV
KRESS
You see, we’ve had our eye on Dr. Quintaine and his research for quite sometime.

DX_S038X_2803_KRESS.WAV
KRESS
Finally, when Dr. Sinclair made her discovery it caused quite a stir among our enemies.

DX_S038X_2804_KRESS.WAV
KRESS
So much so that her object was stolen from her and Quintaine became a marked man.

DX_S038X_2805_KRESS.WAV
KRESS
That’s when it was decided that I was to intervene personally.

DX_S038X_2901_TRENT.WAV
TRENT
What enemies? The Rheinlanders?

DX_S038X_3001_KRESS.WAV
KRESS
Let’s just say that your enemies are our enemies.

DX_S038X_3101_TRENT.WAV
TRENT
Give me a straight answer. Who do you work for, Colonel?

Kress looks at him – and takes a beat.

DX_S038X_3201_KRESS.WAV
KRESS
“The Order”.

Trent and the others look like they’re going to be sick.

DX_S038X_33101_TRENT.WAV
TRENT
You work for Orillion?

DX_S038X_3401_KRESS.WAV
KRESS
My operation is only one cell in the larger organization.

DX_S038X_3402_KRESS.WAV
KRESS
Despite what you may have heard, we are only interested in freedom and peace.

DX_S038X_3501_JUNI.WAV
JUNI
If that’s so, then why all the attacks?

Kress smiles at Juni.

DX_S038X_3601_KRESS.WAV
KRESS
Hm! I understand your suspicion, but …

DX_S038X_3602_KRESS.WAV
KRESS
We are not guilty of nearly as much as your media would suggest.

DX_S038X_3603_KRESS.WAV
KRESS
However, let me ask you this:

DX_S038X_3604_KRESS.WAV
KRESS
Do you think if “The Order” truly wanted you – any of you – to come to harm, you’d be here with me?

Silence. Juni and Trent shake their heads.

DX_S038X_3701_KRESS.WAV
KRESS
So for now, please accept my hospitality in the spirit in which it is offered.

DX_S038X_3702_KRESS.WAV
KRESS
Tell me, what else do you require of me?

Quintaine looks at Sinclair, who nods.

DX_S038X_3801_QUINTAINE.WAV
QUINTAINE
Well, if I’m right, there’s something we’ve overlooked. We need the Proteus Tome.

DX_S038X_3901_TRENT.WAV
TRENT
What’s that?

DX_S038X_4001_SINCLAIR.WAV
SINCLAIR
It’s a peace of parchment resting in the Natural History Museum in Kusari. You see, the Artifact and the Panels have given us a lot of …

DX_S038X_4002_SINCLAIR.WAV
SINCLAIR
…insight, but they both refer back to a missing piece of text.

DX_S038X_4101_QUINTAINE.WAV
QUINTAINE
(RE: The Tome)
I’ve seen it before. I’ve held it. It’s kept in a sealed titanium cylinder in the archives.

DX_S038X_4102_QUINTAINE.WAV
QUINTAINE
It wasn’t until now that I knew we needed it.

DX_S038X_4103_QUINTAINE.WAV
QUINTAINE
I think it holds the answer to the artifact.

DX_S038X_4201_KRESS.WAV
KRESS
Very well! That shouldn’t be difficult. We have an agent in Kusari who may be useful for this.

DX_S038X_4202_KRESS.WAV
KRESS
Lord Hakkera – he’s a local potentate. He can arrange for its “liberation”.

DX_S038X_4301_TRENT.WAV
TRENT
No dice, Kress. If this is as important as they think it is, I’m going myself.

DX_S038X_4401_KRESS.WAV
KRESS
You don’t really trust me, do you, Mr. Trent?

DX_S038X_4501_TRENT.WAV
TRENT
No. But if as you say “your enemies are our enemies”, you won’t deny me this.

DX_S038X_4601_JUNI.WAV
JUNI (O.S.)
Or me.

They turn to her. She’s standing too.

DX_S038X_4701_JUNI.WAV
JUNI
If you’re going, I’m going.

Trent can’t say anything. Kress puts his hands up in concession. They turn and exit frame together.

OBJECTIVE: LAUNCH TO SPACE

When Trent launches from Cali, RAZOR 1 and Juni await him outside the base.

DX_M07_1660_RAZOR_1
KRESS FIGHTER RAZOR 1
Colonel Kress asked me to escort you out of this system. What is your destination?

DX_M07_1670_JUNI
JUNI
We need to get to Kusari space.

DX_M07_1680_RAZOR_1
KRESS FIGHTER RAZOR 1
You’re lucky … there’s a Jump Hole nearby that will get you there in no time. Follow me.

DX_M07_1685_JUNI
JUNI
We have the coordinates. Trent, take point.

OBJECTIVE: GO TO KYUSHU JUMP HOLE

DX_M07_1690_QUINTAINE
QUINTAINE
This is Quintaine. Kress managed to contact his agent Lord Hakkera. He is waiting for you on planet Kyushu. Please contact me when you have the Proteus Tome. In the meantime, Sinclair and I will continue to study the artifact. Good luck.

DX_M07_1700_JUNI
JUNI
We’ll talk to you soon, Professor.

After about 30 seconds of flight time they reach a range trigger around the Jump Hole.

DX_M07_1710_RAZOR_1
KRESS FIGHTER RAZOR 1
This is where we part ways. This Jump Hole leads directly to Kyushu. Best of luck to you!

DX_M07_1720_JUNI
JUNI
Thank you!
(To Trent)
Alright, Trent, go ahead.

OBJECTIVE: TAKE JUMP HOLE TO KYUSHU SYSTEM

When Juni appears on the other side:

DX_M07_1730_JUNI
JUNI
We’re in the Ohka Dust Field. We’ll head to planet Aso and take the Trade Lane from there to Kyushu.

OBJECTIVE: FOLLOW JUNI TO PLANET ASO

After a few seconds of flight…

DX_M07_1740_JUNI
JUNI
It’s funny … I used to fly around this asteroid field when I was younger. My grandmother lives on Tsushima station above Aso. I haven’t been back here in over a decade.

When they reach Tsushima:

DX_M07_1750_JUNI
JUNI
We’re almost there. Take the Trade Lane to Kyushu.

OBJECTIVE: TAKE TRADE LANE TO KYUSHU

Once the exit the Trade Lane near planet Kyushu….

DX_M07_1760_JUNI
JUNI
Trent, land and I’ll follow you in. Lord Hakkera will be waiting for us in the bar.

OBJECTVE: LAND ON PLANET KYUSHU

Auto-play the following scene…

SCENE:	S039X – INT. PLANET HONSHU – BAR

Honshu is a quiet place with a few patrons in the Bar. It's very local and low key; everyone knows everyone here. Trent and Juni walk past LORD HAKKERA, forties, with a small beard, powerful and proud in his robes.

DX_S039X_0101_HAKKERA.WAV
LORD HAKKERA
Mr. Trent, Miss Zane? Please sit down.

They are surprised to have been picked out. They sit.

DX_S039X_0201_HAKKERA.WAV
LORD HAKKERA
I was told you would be coming. I am Lord Hakkera. I am the Prefect of Honshu.

Trent stares at him.

DX_S039X_0301_HAKKERA.WAV
LORD HAKKERA
Is there a problem?

DX_S039X_0401_TRENT.WAV
TRENT
I’m sorry, you’re just not what I expected.

DX_S039X_0501_HAKKERA.WAV
LORD HAKKERA
Because of my affiliation! You expected a terrorist, then?

The assistant is trying to politely get Hakkera’s attention from several yards away.

DX_S039X_05A01_HAKKERA_ASSIST.WAV
HAKKERA ASSISTENT
Lord Hakkera.

DX_S039X_0502_HAKKERA.WAV
LORD HAKKERA
I serve “The Order” to help my people Mr. Trent. Especially now in the face of unchecked Rheinland aggression.

DX_S039X_0503_HAKKERA.WAV
LORD HAKKERA
Meanwhile, I understand you are here for the Proteus Tome.

DX_S039X_0504_HAKKERA.WAV
LORD HAKKERA
Unfortunately, that will not be easy. The artifacts in the museum have come under renewed scrutiny.

DX_S039X_0505_HAKKERA.WAV
LORD HAKKERA
I will need to secure special permission for us to be allowed access.

Another ND man walks in the bar and signals Hakkera. He sees this and seems concerned.

DX_S039X_0601_HAKKERA.WAV
LORD HAKKERA
Please excuse me. I’ve recently lost contact with one of my operatives in Rheinland. This may be news.

DX_S039X_0602_HAKKERA.WAV
LORD HAKKERA
I will be in touch once I get access to the Proteus Tome.

Hakkera rises quickly and walks to meet the man.

DX_S039X_0701_TRENT.WAV
TRENT
That’s it? What are we supposed to do now, wait?

DX_S039X_0801_JUNI.WAV
JUNI
Like hell we will. I have contact here, too.

Juni gets up.

DX_S039X_0802_JUNI.WAV
JUNI
But to get to them we’re going to have to split up for a while.

DX_S039X_0901_TRENT.WAV
TRENT
What about that “if you’re going, I’m going” stuff. What am I supposed to do around here while you’re gone?

DX_S039X_1001_JUNI.WAV
JUNI
You should try to fit in a little, maybe get some work. By the sound of things, this may take a while.

DX_S039X_1002_JUNI.WAV
JUNI
Don’t worry, I won’t be far.

She touches his shoulder as she leaves. Trent now sits alone.

OBJECTIVE: FREE TIME

MISSION:	BECOMES AVAILABLE

This message plays whenever a story mission becomes available (restriction might be that the player has to be in space this to play).

DX_M08_0000_JUNI
JUNI
Trent! It took a while, but I finally found what we’re looking for. Meet me on Shinkaku station in the New Tokyo system. It’s urgent.

Once the player docks with Shinkaku and walks into the bar, the following scene automatically plays.

SCENE:	S045A – OFFER – INT. SHINKAKU STATION – BAR

Trent approaches Juni at the bar.

DX_S045A_0101_JUNI.WAV
JUNI
You came!

DX_S045A_0201_TRENT.WAV
TRENT
Yeah, I was starting to wonder if we were partners anymore.

DX_S045A_0301_JUNI.WAV
JUNI
I just had to dig a little deeper than I thought.

DX_S045A_0302_JUNI.WAV
JUNI
Trent, I heard from Lord Hakkera. He says that the Proteus Tome …

DX_S045A_0303_JUNI.WAV
JUNI
… and all of the museum artifacts have now come under the personal control of Governor Tekagi.

DX_S045A_0304_JUNI.WAV
JUNI
Hakkera can’t help us.

DX_S045A_0401_TRENT.WAV
TRENT
What do you mean? That’s why we came!

DX_S045A_0501_JUNI.WAV
JUNI
You have to understand Kusari customs, Hakkera is a Lord.

DX_S045A_0502_JUNI.WAV
JUNI
His position gives him power, but also limits him. There’s only so much he can do before he violates his station.

DX_S045A_0503_JUNI.WAV
JUNI
Anyway, I’m onto something, but you’re going to have to trust me on this one.

DX_S045A_0504_JUNI.WAV
JUNI
If we do this, we do it together, understand? Are you in?

After the scene has finished, the MISSION OFFER PANEL appears with more detailed information concerning the mission and offering choices to ACCEPT or DECLINE the mission.

The Offer Panel comes up:

GET THE PROTEUS TOME

Objective:	Attack a transport in the nearby Honshu system that is secretly transporting the Proteus Tome to Rheinland. Join Ozu and a Blood Dragon strike force in their attempt to capture the transport.
Difficulty:	The transport is under heavy guard and will be well defended. This mission will be very difficult and a potent combat vessel is highly recommended.
Reward:	The Proteus Tome – the very reason why you came to Kusari.

SCENE:	S045B – ACCEPT – INT. SHINKAKU STATION – BAR

DX_S045B_0101_TRENT.WAV
TRENT
Why not? I’ve come this far, haven’t I?

DX_S045B_0201_JUNI.WAV
JUNI
Thank you.

She walks hi over towards some tables.

DX_S045B_0301_JUNI.WAV
JUNI
One last thing, the man you’re about to meet is very high up in the Kusari resistance.

DX_S045B_0302_JUNI.WAV
JUNI
Whatever you do, don’t mention my affiliation with the LSF.

DX_S045B_0401_TRENT.WAV
TRENT
Alright!

She keeps walking out of frame.

DX_S045B_0501_TRENT.WAV
TRENT
Wait! Kusari has a resistance movement?

Her hand quickly pulls him out of frame, too. They walk up to a seated man, OZU, 30’s or so, Kusari, with a scar, a Lieutenant for the Black Dragons.

DX_S045B_0601_JUNI.WAV
JUNI
Ozu, this is Trent, the man I told you about.

DX_S045B_0701_OZU.WAV
OZU
Ah, Mr. Trent. Jun’ko speaks highly of you. Please sit.

DX_S045B_0801_TRENT.WAV
TRENT
Thanks.

Trent sits across from him. Jun'ko pours them both drinks, as is still the custom.

DX_S045B_0901_OZU.WAV
OZU
Since Jun’ko’s departure to Liberty many things have changed here.

DX_S045B_0902_OZU.WAV
OZU
The old ways are dying out as we become more of a melting pot of cultures.

DX_S045B_0903_OZU.WAV
OZU
Do you understand?

DX_S045B_1001_TRENT.WAV
TRENT
I think I do.

DX_S045B_1101_OZU.WAV
OZU
The one thing that has not changed is the face of treachery.

DX_S045B_1102_OZU.WAV
OZU
It is something that we have fought for many generations.

DX_S045B_1201_JUNI.WAV
JUNI
Ozu is a lieutenant in the Blood Dragons, a counter political group that opposes the Shogun.

DX_S045B_1301_OZU.WAV
OZU
The reason the Blood Dragons have survived…

DX_S045B_1302_OZU.WAV
OZU
…is because of our ability to adapt and change … to out-maneuver the stronger opponent.

DX_S045B_1303_OZU.WAV
OZU
This would not be possible without carefully nurtured relationships, Mr. Trent.

DX_S045B_1304_OZU.WAV
OZU
Which brings me to you!

DX_S045B_1305_OZU.WAV
OZU
I am told that you and “The Order” seek a certain artifact.

The affiliation with “The Order” catches Trent off guard.

DX_S045B_1401_TRENT.WAV
TRENT
That’s right. The Proteus Tome. It’s fallen under the control of governor Tekagi.

DX_S045B_1501_OZU.WAV
OZU
Yes, Tekagi.

DX_S045B_1502_OZU.WAV
OZU
He has been acting strangely, even for him, since his return from Rheinland.

DX_S045B_1503_OZU.WAV
OZU
Our sources now say that there is a secret transport being loaded with these artifacts bound from Tekagi…

DX_S045B_1504_OZU.WAV
OZU
…back to the Chancellor.

DX_S045B_1505_OZU.WAV
OZU
We believe the Proteus Tome is one of those on board.

Trent looks at Juni, who confirms this with a nod.

DX_S045B_1601_TRENT.WAV
TRENT
(Hard – to Ozu)
How much time do we have?

DX_S045B_1701_OZU.WAV
OZU
Little! Particularly since Tekagi himself may be on that Transport.

DX_S045B_1801_TRENT.WAV
TRENT
He’s defecting?

DX_S045B_1901_OZU.WAV
OZU
We believe so. With an offering to his new Lord and Master, the Chancellor.

DX_S045B_1902_OZU.WAV
OZU
Again, the face of treachery has not changed.

DX_S045B_1903_OZU.WAV
OZU
Our vendetta with Tekagi is an old one.

DX_S045B_1904_OZU.WAV
OZU
Unfortunately, we may only have this one last opportunity to repay him for his crimes.

DX_S045B_1905_OZU.WAV
OZU
Mr. Trent, here is what I propose.

DX_S045B_1906_OZU.WAV
OZU
You and “The Order” shall have what you desire, if you help rid us of Tekagi.

Trent looks to Juni and wrestles with this. She does not know what he will do. She leans down.

DX_S045B_2001_JUNI.WAV
JUNI
(Sotto – reassuring)
Trent, Tekagi is a traitor to his people.

DX_S045B_2101_OZU.WAV
OZU
He deserves to die. Do us this service.

DX_S045B_2201_TRENT.WAV
TRENT
(Finally)
Agreed.

DX_S045B_2301_OZU.WAV
OZU
Excellent! We leave at once.

Juni breathes a quiet sigh of relief. Ozu gets up and herds Juni and Trent out.

SCENE:	S045C – DECLINE – INT. SHINKAKU STATION – BAR

DX_S045C_0101_TRENT.WAV
TRENT
No. I can’t do it.

DX_S045C_0201_JUNI.WAV
JUNI
(Disappointed)
Why not?

DX_S045C_0301_TRENT.WAV
TRENT
I’m sorry, Juni. It’s not that I don’t trust you…

DX_S045C_0401_JUNI.WAV
JUNI
No?

DX_S045C_0501_TRENT.WAV
TRENT
I just need more time before I take another blind leap

He starts to walk off.

DX_S045C_0601_JUNI.WAV
JUNI
Trent!?

DX_S045C_0701_TRENT.WAV
TRENT
(Not turning around)
No.

He keeps walking - out of frame.

SCENE:	S045D – REOFFER – INT. SHINKAKU STATION – BAR

Juni is at the bar when Trent comes in.  She looks up.

DX_S045D_0101_JUNI.WAV
JUNI
What are you doing back here?

DX_S045D_0201_TRENT.WAV
TRENT
We have some unfinished business.

DX_S045D_0301_JUNI.WAV
JUNI
Do we? I thought that was over when you walked out on me last time.

DX_S045D_0401_TRENT.WAV
TRENT
I said I just needed a little time!

DX_S045D_0501_JUNI.WAV
JUNI
So are you saying you’re ready to trust me now?

After the scene has finished, the MISSION OFFER PANEL appears with more detailed information concerning the mission and offering choices to ACCEPT or DECLINE the mission.

OBJECTIVE: LAUNCH TO SPACE

DX_M08_0100_OZU
OZU
Mr. Trent, we will take the Trade Lane from here to the Honshu Gate. Follow me.

DX_M08_0105_JUNI
JUNI
Coordinates received. Trent, take point.

OBJECTIVE: GO TO HONSHU GATE

On their way to the Trade Lane:

DX_M08_0110_OZU
OZU
My sources tell me that the Tekagi’s transport is currently docked at the Yukawa shipyard in Honshu. It is heavily guarded. Apparently they are taking additional cargo onboard … 

DX_M08_0120_JUNI
JUNI
Is it the Tome…?

DX_M08_0130_OZU
OZU
That is very possible. Yukawa is a Kishiro Base and Tekagi owns a large portion of that organization.

They enter the Trade Lane to the Honshu Gate … while in transit:

DX_M08_0140_OZU
OZU
I have made plans to rendezvous with a Blood Dragon attack force before we attack the transports.

When they exit the Trade Lane at the Honshu Gate:

DX_M08_0150_OZU
OZU
We are not going through the Jump Gate, Mr. Trent. Blood Dragon fighters are awaiting us at a nearby Jump Hole. I’m uploading the coordinates.

OBJECTIVE: GO TO RENDEZVOUS POINT

Ozu, Trent and Juni fly into the Chiba Field in order to meet with additional Blood Dragon forces.

DX_M08_0160_JUNI
JUNI
Why are we taking a Jump Hole?

DX_M08_0170_OZU
OZU
Tekagi is a powerful man, Jun’ko. He has spies everywhere. If we want to have a chance to capture the transport, we need to take them by surprise.

When they reach a range trigger around the Blood Dragon fighters:

DX_M08_0180_DRAGON_1
BLOOD DRAGON 1
We have you in range. Standing by for orders!

DX_M08_0190_OZU
OZU
Enter formation and follow us to the Jump Hole.

DX_M08_0200_DRAGON_1
BLOOD DRAGON 1
Entering formation!

DX_M08_0210_OZU
OZU
Set course for the Jump Hole.

Three Heavy Border World Fighters join formation with Ozu.

OBJECTIVE: GO TO HONSHU JUMP HOLE

DX_M08_0220_JUNI
JUNI
Only three ships?

DX_M08_0230_OZU
OZU
The Blood Dragons are small in numbers, Jun’ko, but they are the best fighter pilots in the colonies.

They reach an area trigger very near the Jump Hole.

DX_M08_0240_OZU
OZU
There is the Jump Hole. Mr. Trent, please go first.

OBJECTIVE: TAKE JUMP HOLE TO HONSHU

On the other side of the Jump Gate, another Blood Dragon fighter awaits them.

OZU
Report!

DX_M08_0260_DRAGON_2
BLOOD DRAGON 2
The transport is still docking with Yukawa, Ozu-sensei, but it looked like they were about to leave. I counted multiple heavy weapon platforms and strong fighter protection. It won’t be easy.

DX_M08_0270_OZU
OZU
We don’t have any time to waste. Let’s go!

OBJECTIVE: FOLLOW OZU TO YUKAWA SHIPYARD

The group starts flying toward the Yukawa shipyard. They are well within the nebula at this point.

DX_M08_0280_JUNI
JUNI
What’s our plan?

DX_M08_0290_OZU
OZU
We have to hit them quickly and decisively. First, we target the weapon platforms, then the fighter escorts.

DX_M08_0300_JUNI
JUNI
How do we get to the transport?

DX_M08_0310_OZU
OZU
We have a strike force positioned on Yukawa that will seize control of the transport. Once we’ve eliminated the fighters, our people will fly the transport out of there. 

DX_M08_0320_JUNI
JUNI
Understood!

DX_M08_0330_OZU
OZU
The nebula will cover us most of the way, but the final approach will be in open space. We will have to fly as fast as possible before their scanners detect us. Every second will count.

They reach the edge of the nebula and the shipyard can be seen in the distance.

DX_M08_0340_OZU
OZU
There is the shipyard. Is everybody ready?

DX_M08_0350_DRAGON_1
BLOOD DRAGON 1
Dragon 1, ready to engage.

DX_M08_0360_DRAGON_2
BLOOD DRAGON 2
Dragon 2, ready!

DX_M08_0370_JUNI
JUNI
I’m ready, Ozu!

DX_M08_0380_OZU
OZU
(Tense)
Our first targets are the weapon platforms! All ships, engage!

OBJECTIVE: DESTORY WEAPON PLATFORMS

IF the first weapon platform is destroyed

DX_M08_0390_JUNI
JUNI
(Triumphant)
The first platform is gone!

DX_M08_0400_OZU
OZU
(Urgent)
Quickly, take out the other one. We’re taking heavy fire from its turrets.

IF the second weapon platform is destroyed

DX_M08_0410_OZU
OZU
(Triumphant)
The second platform is down! Ozu to Strike team … operation is a go! All ships, take out the escort fighters.

IF one Blood Dragon fighter is destroyed

DX_M08_0420_OZU
OZU
(Urgent)
We have lost a fighter. We need to cover each other!

IF a second Blood Dragon fighter is destroyed

DX_M08_0430_OZU
OZU
(Urgent)
We have lost another ship. This is getting close!

IF a third Blood Dragon fighter is destroyed

DX_M08_0440_OZU
OZU
(Urgent)
We’re down to one fighter. Jun’ko, Mr. Trent, we have to take out the hostile fighters!

IF the last Blood Dragon fighter is destroyed

DX_M08_0450_OZU
OZU
(Urgent)
Our last fighter is down. Jun’ko, Mr. Trent, .it’s up to us now!

IF first escort fighter is destroyed

DX_M08_0460_OZU
OZU
(Excited)
One of their fighters is down. Engage the other fighters … 

IF second escort fighter is destroyed

DX_M08_0470_OZU
OZU
(Excited)
Another escort fighter destroyed! Hold on …
(Soft sfx of strike team chatter, shouts, and gunfire)
I have a report from the strike team. They caught Tekagi’s men off guard and have them pinned down.

IF third escort fighter is destroyed

DX_M08_0480_OZU
OZU
(Excited)
Got another one!

IF forth escort fighter is destroyed

DX_M08_0490_OZU
OZU
(Triumphant)
To all ships! The strike team has successfully taken over the transport. Disengage and protect the transport.

The transport’s vibe changes to friend_threshold and is now leaving its position in the shipyard; it moves toward the Jump Hole to Chugoku.

OBJECTIVE: PROTECT THE TRANSPORT

The transport is now on a tether to the Chugoku Jump Hole and has to be defended. Note that none of the hostiles have missiles.

DX_M08_0500_OZU
OZU
Strike team, what is your status?

DX_M08_0510_TRANSPORT
TRANSPORT
We lost two of our men, Sensei, but it was worth it. The cargo pods are full of gold, diamonds and thousands of artifacts.

DX_M08_0520_OZU
OZU
Excellent! Proceed into the nebula.

IF Transport health is down to 50%

DX_M08_0530_TRANSPORT
TRANSPORT
We’re taking damage!

IF Transport health is down to 20%

DX_M08_0540_TRANSPORT
TRANSPORT
We’re hit! We’ve lost pressure in one compartment. We cannot take much more damage!

Once the group reaches the nebula, the enemy fighters from the Yukawa shipyard no longer follow them. After about 30 sec. they run into a group of four hostile fighters.

OBJECTIVE: DESTROY ENEMY FIGHTERS

DX_M08_0550_TRANSPORT
TRANSPORT
Four hostiles dead ahead, Sensei!

DX_M08_0560_OZU
OZU
Jun’ko, Mr. Trent … we have to destroy these fighters before we jump.

DX_M08_0570_JUNI
JUNI
Understood! Come on, Trent!

After the last enemy ship has been destroyed:

DX_M08_0580_OZU
OZU
Proceed to the Jump Hole. We should be safe now.

The group reaches the Jump Hole to Chugoku.

DX_M08_0590_OZU
OZU
This is the Jump Hole to the Chugoku system. Mr. Trent, please go first.

OBJECTIVE: TAKE JUMP HOLE TO CHUGOKU

When they appear on the other side, they’re welcomed by a ring of Blood Dragon defense platforms and a wing of Heavy Border World Fighters.

DX_M08_0600_DRAGON_3
BLOOD DRAGON 3
Identify yourself or you will be destroyed.

Ozu and the transport come through the Jump Hole.

DX_M08_0610_OZU
OZU
This is Lieutenant Ozu. Stand down, patrol. We have captured Tekagi’s transport and are escorting it back to Kyoto as ordered.

DX_M08_0620_DRAGON_3
BLOOD DRAGON 3
(Obedient)
Yes, Sensei.

DX_M08_0630_OZU
OZU
We are almost there. Jun’ko, Mr. Trent. Follow me.

DX_M08_0635_JUNI
JUNI
I have the coordinates. Trent, you take the lead.

OBJECTIVE: GO TO BLOOD DRAGON BASE

DX_M08_0640_JUNI
JUNI
Where are we going?

DX_M08_0650_OZU
OZU
To Kyoto!

DX_M08_0660_JUNI
JUNI
Kyoto!? Trent … that’s the legendary home of the Blood Dragons! I don’t know anyone who’s ever seen it. Ozu, you honor us.

DX_M08_0665_OZU
OZU
The honor is ours.

They reach the large asteroid base…

DX_M08_0670_OZU
OZU
Here we will celebrate our victory over Tekagi and Edo. Here you shall receive what you came for … I will see you shortly.

OBJECTIVE: LAND ON KYOTO

SCENE:	S046X –INT. BLACK DRAGON BASE KYOTO – LANDING DECK

The ships land with their cargo and Trent emerges. He is taken by the size of the base. Men begin to work on opening the cargo immediately. Ozu appears.

DX_S046X_0101_TRENT.WAV
TRENT
Lieutenant Ozu, this is amazing. How long have the Blood Dragons been here in this asteroid?

DX_S046X_0201_OZU.WAV
OZU
Several generations!

DX_S046X_0202_OZU.WAV
OZU
But with Tekagi eliminated, the Edo Shogunate is weaker and our victory is near.

One of his men comes from the cargo and stands waiting for Ozu.  Ozu sees this.

DX_S046X_0301_OZU.WAV
OZU
Excuse me.

Ozu goes and confers with him as Juni steps up to Trent.

DX_S046X_0401_TRENT.WAV
TRENT
(To Juni)
Tell me, how long have you known Ozu?

DX_S046X_0501_JUNI.WAV
JUNI
You mean was he always a radical in the Blood Dragons?

DX_S046X_0502_JUNI.WAV
JUNI
No. When I knew him he was to be a promising political student at the Kusari Academy.

DX_S046X_0601_TRENT.WAV
TRENT
What happened?

DX_S046X_0701_JUNI.WAV
JUNI
People are changed by their world, Trent, rarely vice versa.

DX_S046X_0702_JUNI.WAV
JUNI
Ozu is living proof of that. My father knew this.

DX_S046X_0703_JUNI.WAV
JUNI
He wanted for us to at least have a choice of what world would shape us.

DX_S046X_0705_JUNI.WAV
JUNI
Since he was from Liberty and my mother was from here, we followed his diplomatic ties to Manhattan.

DX_S046X_0801_TRENT.WAV
TRENT
(Mildly sarcastic)
And left all this behind!

DX_S046X_0901_JUNI.WAV
JUNI
(Means it in many ways)
That’s right.

Ozu comes back, looking dour.

DX_S046X_1001_OZU.WAV
OZU
(Sighs angrily)
I’m afraid we have been deceived.

DX_S046X_1002_OZU.WAV
OZU
This was the right shipment, but we have neither the artifacts nor Tekagi.

DX_S046X_1003_OZU.WAV
OZU
He was not on the transport as we were lead to believe. Something has changed.

DX_S046X_1101_TRENT.WAV
TRENT
So what do we do now?

DX_S046X_1201_OZU.WAV
OZU
I will make the necessary inquiries.

DX_S046X_1202_OZU.WAV
OZU
For now, I suggest that you occupy yourselves with whatever diversions we can offer.

Juni and Trent mull this over as a consumed Ozu walks off.

DX_S046X_1301_JUNI.WAV
JUNI
Well, I can’t just sit here … maybe the Blood Dragons could use a little help.

DX_S046X_1401_TRENT.WAV
TRENT
Joining the ranks of the “radical left”?

DX_S046X_1501_JUNI.WAV
JUNI
I’m not on assignment anymore, Trent. I get to see how the other side lives.

DX_S046X_1502_JUNI.WAV
JUNI
You know, it wouldn’t hurt you to get out there for a while either, maybe take some missions.

DX_S046X_1503_JUNI.WAV
JUNI
From the sound of things it may be a while. Don’t worry I’ll let you know when we hear something.

Interrupting with bad news from a few feet away:
DX_S046X_1504_OZU_ASST_1.WAV
OZU ASSISTANT
Pardon me, Lieutenant.

She leaves Trent alone on the deck.

OBJECTIVE: FREE TIME

MISSION:	BECOMES AVAILABLE

This message plays whenever a story mission becomes available (restriction might be that the player has to be in space this to play).

DX_M09_0000_OZU
OZU
Mr. Trent. I have new information about the Proteus Tome and Governor Tekagi. It is imperative that you return to Kyoto as soon as possible.

Once the player docks with Kyoto and walks into the bar, the following scene automatically plays.

SCENE:	S050A – INT. BLACK DRAGON BASE KYOTO – BAR

Trent walks up to Ozu who is sitting in the Lounge.

DX_S050A_0101_OZU.WAV
OZU
Ah, I’m glad you have arrived. I have news.

Trent sits.

DX_S050A_0201_OZU.WAV
OZU
As we feared Governor Tekagi is indeed alive. In fact, I am told that he has secretly left the palace...

DX_S050A_0202_OZU.WAV
OZU
… and has moved the artifacts to his fortified retreat … a remote planetoid with many defenses.

DX_S050A_0203_OZU.WAV
OZU
But I have come up with a plan that should get us both what we want. Shall we proceed?

After the scene has finished, the MISSION OFFER PANEL appears with more detailed information concerning the mission and offering choices to ACCEPT or DECLINE the mission.

The Offer Panel comes up:

ATTACK TEKAGI’S FORTRESS

Objective:	Attack Tekagi’s fortified base in the Tohoku System. You have to enter his base and steal the Proteus Tome out of Tekagi’s control.
Difficulty:	Tekagi’s fortress is heavily protected and it will be very difficult to get into the complex. It is likely that it will be even harder on the way out since the defenses will be alerted to your presence.
Reward:	The Proteus Tome – the very reason why you came to Kusari.

SCENE:	S050B – ACCEPT – INT. BLACK DRAGON BASE KYOTO – BAR

DX_S050B_0101_TRENT.WAV
TRENT
Okay. Let’s do it. Have you told Juni yet?

DX_S050B_0201_OZU.WAV
OZU
This is for us alone, Mr. Trent.

Trent thinks about this.

DX_S050B_0301_TRENT.WAV
TRENT
I see.

DX_S050B_0401_OZU.WAV
OZU
(Getting up)
Come, we have no time to waste. My attack squad is ready. I’ll brief you in space.

Ozu leads him out of the lounge.

SCENE:	S050C – DECLINE – INT. BLACK DRAGON BASE KYOTO – BAR

DX_S050C_0101_TRENT.WAV
TRENT
I’m not ready to go up against Tekagi’s men so soon.

Trent gets up.

DX_S050C_0201_OZU.WAV
OZU
I’m disappointed to hear that. “The Order” has a reputation for being ruthless and unstoppable.

DX_S050C_0202_OZU.WAV
OZU
I must say I expected more…

Trent nods and walks towards the door.

DX_S050C_0301_TRENT.WAV
TRENT
(Solemnly – under his breath)
I don’t work for “The Order”.

He walks past us, leaving Ozu sitting at the table.

SCENE:	S050D – REOFFER – INT. BLACK DRAGON BASE KYOTO – BAR

Trent enters the Lounge and finds Ozu still at his table.

DX_S050D_0101_OZU.WAV
OZU
I must say I am surprised to see you again.

DX_S050D_0201_TRENT.WAV
TRENT
Don’t be.

DX_S050D_0301_OZU.WAV
OZU
Have you reconsidered so quickly?

After the scene has finished, the MISSION OFFER PANEL appears with more detailed information concerning the mission and offering choices to ACCEPT or DECLINE the mission.

OBJECTIVE: LAUNCH TO SPACE

MISSION:	ATTACK TEGAKI’S FORTRESS

When Trent emerges from the giant asteroid base:

DX_M09_0100_OZU
OZU
(Urgent)
Mr. Trent, my informants report that Tekagi is preparing to leave his fortress. We have little time. Follow me.

OBJECTIVE: GO TO WAYPOINT

Trent and Ozu fly alone toward the Jump Hole to the Tohoku system. After a few seconds, Juni sends an ether comm..:

DX_M09_0110_JUNI
JUNI
(Alarmed)
Trent! Ozu! I heard you are leaving!? What’s going on?

DX_M09_0120_OZU
OZU
(Heavy and foreshadowing)
We are attempting to retrieve the Proteus Tome, Jun’ko.
(A beat)
We’re flying to Tekagi’s arch.

DX_M09_0130_JUNI
JUNI
(Alarmed … near panic)
No! That’s suicide. The arch is too well defended.

DX_M09_0140_OZU
OZU
(Slow, heavy and foreshadowing)
This is our last chance, Jun’ko. Tekagi is leaving for Rheinland.

DX_M09_0150_JUNI
JUNI
(Alarmed … near panic)
There must be another way!

DX_M09_0160_OZU
OZU
(Slow, heavy and foreshadowing)
Our plan is to sneak into the base without being detected. We will find the Tome … and kill Tekagi.
(A beat)
Wish us luck! Ozu out!

DX_M09_0165_JUNI
JUNI
(Snubs)
Just don’t get yourselves killed.

After a few seconds of silence:

DX_M09_0170_OZU
OZU
Tekagi’s arch is only one system away from here in Tohoku. The Blood Dragons discovered a Jump Hole to there over 20 years ago. It will bring us very close to his base.
(A beat)
We’re approaching the hole now.

When they enter a range trigger around

DX_M09_0180_OZU
OZU
There it is … Mr. Trent, go ahead and jump. A fighter wing is awaiting us on the other side.

OBJECTIVE: TAKE JUMP HOLE TO TOHOKU SYSTEM

Upon arrival in the Tohoku system, Trent and Ozu are welcomed by three Blood Dragon fighters.

DX_M09_0190_OZU
OZU
Report!

DX_M09_0200_DRAGON_1
BLOOD DRAGON 1
There is a lot of activity in this system, Lieutenant. Tekagi has drastically increased his patrols within the last few hours. It almost seems like he is expecting an attack.

DX_M09_0210_OZU
OZU
Mr. Trent, we have to be careful. This system is littered with hidden defense systems and patrol wings. Sneaking into Tekagi’s fortress won’t be easy. Follow me.

DX_M09_0211_DRAGON_1
BLOOD DRAGON 1
We have uploaded the coordinates of Tekagi’s base. Mr. Trent, take the lead. We’ll follow you.

OBJECTIVE: GO TO WAYPOINT

Ozu flies in the direction of the planetary arch. After a few seconds of flight:

DX_M09_0220_OZU
OZU
The Blood Dragons are only here to cover our retreat once we have the Proteus Tome.
(A beat)
You and I will have to sneak into the arch alone and get it.

Suddenly, one of the Blood Dragons picks up several signals.

DX_M09_0230_DRAGON_1
BLOOD DRAGON 1
I am picking up several contacts.

Seconds later, a Kusari Military patrol consisting of two Kusari Light Fighters attacks the group.

DX_M09_0240_OZU
OZU
(Alerted)
They found us! We have to destroy those ships before they can call for help. Don’t let them get away!

OBJECTIVE: DESTROY KUSARI MILITARY PATROL

IF first Kusari Military scout is destroyed

DX_M09_0250_OZU
OZU
(Triumphant)
We got the first one!

IF second Kusari Military scout is destroyed

DX_M09_0260_OZU
OZU
(Triumphant)
The patrol has been eliminated. Proceed to the target.

IF one of the patrol ships got away

DX_M09_0270_OZU
OZU
(Dark and foreshadowing)
The patrol has escaped. It will be even harder to get into the arch undetected.

IF patrol has been destroyed before the player gets into visual range of the arch

DX_M09_0280_OZU
OZU
(Dark and foreshadowing)
Mr. Trent, this is the Tohoku planetary arch. Once one of the wonders of Kusari ingenuity … now it is a fortress of deceit and evil.
(A beat)
Dragons! Stay here and await our return.

DX_M09_0290_DRAGON_1
BLOOD DRAGON 1
Yes, Lieutenant.

The remaining Blood Dragon fighters stay behind and only Ozu and Trent fly toward the giant object in the distance. 

DX_M09_0300_OZU
OZU
(Dark and foreshadowing)
We have but one chance to stop Tekagi. Follow me … into the demon’s lair.

OBJECTIVE: FOLLOW OZU

DX_M09_0310_OZU
OZU
(Somewhat hopeful)
No contacts so far … maybe we’re lucky.

A few more seconds before the duo reaches a range trigger … suddenly two Kusari Gunboats and four Heavy Fighters uncloak very near Ozu’s and Trent’s position. The ships open fire!

DX_M09_0320_OZU
OZU
(Hectic)
It’s a trap! Engage!

These are overwhelming odds and both ships are quickly taking heavy damage. If either Trent or Ozu take 25% damage, the remaining Blood Dragon fighters come in to support them.

DX_M09_0330_DRAGON_1
BLOOD DRAGON 1
This is Dragon 1. Ready to assist!

DX_M09_0340_OZU
OZU
(Hectic)
Dragon 1, we must take out these Gunboats at all costs. Mr. Trent and I have to find another way into the arch. Cover us!

DX_M09_0350_DRAGON_1
BLOOD DRAGON 1
(Determined)
Understood! Long live the Blood Dragons!!!

Dragon 1 attacks the Gunboats with his remaining Dragons. Very quickly, the large ships explode in big explosions. Note: we need to secretly switch all gunboats/fighters to only attack the Blood Dragon wing so that they won’t follow Ozu and Trent into the nebula.

DX_M09_0360_OZU
OZU
(Deliberate and urgent)
We have to change our plan, Mr. Trent. Follow me! Quickly!

The remaining Dragons will attempt to follow Ozu and Trent and join formation on the way to Ryuku.

OBJECTIVE: FOLLOW OZU

Ozu leads Trent into the nearby nebula.

DX_M09_0370_OZU
OZU
(Depressed)
Tekagi is now alerted to our presence. Our plan to sneak into his base undetected will no longer work … 

DX_M09_0380_OZU
OZU
(Determined)
A different strategy is required. We’re flying to a nearby outpost of the Blood Dragons. If we cannot sneak into the fortress, then we have to attack it with force.
(A beat)
Outpost Ryuku, this is Lieutenant Ozu. Requesting permission to land!

DX_M09_0390_RYUKU
OUTPOST RYUKU
Lieutenant, we have monitored your operation and are standing by. Our forces are at your disposal.

DX_M09_0391_RYUKU
OUTPOST RYUKU
Long range radar indicates that there are a large number of ships assembled in the area near the arch. It appears Tekagi is leaving his fortress.

A few seconds later, the Outposts comes in sight and Ozu sends a comm. to Trent.

DX_M09_0400_OZU
OZU
Mr. Trent, I have to discuss our options with the commander of this base. Please land. You should repair your ship and rearm yourself. We have to go back to the arch … Tekagi will not get away!

DX_M09_0401_RYUKU
OUTPOST RYUKU
We are uploading the coordinates of the arch into your Neural Net.
(A beat)
Long live the Dragons.

Ozu awaits Trent outside and immediately sends a comm. He is surrounded by 12 Blood Dragon fighters.

DX_M09_0410_OZU
OZU
We have decided to attack Tekagi’s base with full force. We have to hurry. If Tekagi escapes, we will forever miss our opportunity to retrieve the Tome and end that demon’s life. Follow us.

OBJECTIVE: FOLLOW OZU TO TEKAGI’S ARCH

The large group of fighters leaves to attack Tekagi’s base.

DX_M09_0420_DRAGON_2
BLOOD DRAGON 2
(Determined)
Tekagi will use whatever means he has at his disposal to stop us.

DX_M09_0430_OZU
OZU
Dragon 2, you know his base defenses … what is our best option?

DX_M09_0440_DRAGON_2
BLOOD DRAGON 2
You and Mr. Trent should approach from beneath the base. Located there is a large cylindrical stabilizer used to reinforce the structure of the planetoid. The safest approach would be through this opening.
(A beat)
We will attempt to occupy his forces and draw them away from the base. That should buy you enough time to break in – hopefully unnoticed.

DX_M09_0450_OZU
OZU
Good. Let’s do it. Long live the Blood Dragons!

DX_M09_0460_DRAGON_2
BLOOD DRAGON 2
(Determined)
Long live the Dragons!

DX_M09_0470_DRAGON_3
BLOOD DRAGON 3
(Determined)
Long live the Dragons! Death to Tekagi!

When they come out of the nebula and head toward the planetary arch in open space.

DX_M09_0480_OZU
OZU
There is the arch. Strange … I am not picking up any ships.

DX_M09_0490_DRAGON_2
BLOOD DRAGON 2
Something is wrong.

Suddenly, four large Kusari Gunboats and one Cruiser uncloak directly in front of them.

DX_M09_0500_DRAGON_2
BLOOD DRAGON 2
It’s a trap. Dragons, engage!

All chaos breaks loose and the Dragons come under heavy fire.

IF first Dragon is down

DX_M09_0510_DRAGON_2
BLOOD DRAGON 2
Dammit! Lieutenant Ozu, make your run.

IF second Dragon is down

DX_M09_0520_DRAGON_2
BLOOD DRAGON 2
We lost another ship. Ozu, you have to get into the arch now .. we can’t hold them back!

Ozu asks Trent to follow him underneath the arch.

DX_M09_0530_OZU
OZU
Mr. Trent, follow me. We have to approach from beneath the planetoid. I’ve uploaded an approach vector. Come on!

OBJECTIVE: FOLLOW OZU TO TUBE ENTRANCE

IF third Dragon is down

DX_M09_0540_DRAGON_2
BLOOD DRAGON 2
We’re being picked off like flies. Ozu, you have to hurry!

IF forth Dragon is down

DX_M09_0550_DRAGON_2
BLOOD DRAGON 2
We can’t withstand this firepower much longer. Hurry!

Once Trent and Ozu arrive at the bottom of the tubular structure

DX_M09_0560_OZU
OZU
This is it!  Follow me through the stabilizer and dock with the arch. I think we might get in undetected.

OBJECTIVE: FLY THROUGH TUBE TO ARCH ENTANCE

IF player takes too long several Kusari fighters spawn and engage Trent.

DX_M09_0570_OZU
OZU
We’re out of time. The Dragons are being shot to pieces. Our distraction is not working. Quick, land on the arch!

IF player takes more than 20 sec after 570 and still hasn’t docked with the base, we make Ozu’s vulnerable. Once Ozu’s ship takes critical damage:

DX_M09_0580_OZU
OZU
(Panicked)
We have to land. I’m under heavy fire.
(Explosion)
Ahhhh!

Note: if the player fails to dock, we simply spawn more and more hostiles and the mission will eventually fail.

Once Trent has flown through the tube and arrives underneath the arch

OBJECTIVE: DOCK WITH ARCH

IF player makes it to the arch and is docking

DX_M09_0590_OZU
OZU
Good work! I will meet you on the deck.

SCENE:	S051XA –INT. TEKAGI’S PLANETARY ARCH BASE – LANDING DECK

Trent and Ozu’s ships come into the atmosphere (what little there is), hot and fast.  Tekagi’s Arch-fortress, a miracle of engineering and design, towering above the land masses below, stands forbiddingly in the distance.  With a blast of plasma, Ozu suddenly surges ahead of Trent - leaving him a virtual standstill.

DX_S051X_0101_TRENT.WAV
TRENT (V.O.)
(Tense & a little nervous)
Do you think Tekagi’s gone?

DX_S051X_0201_OZU.WAV
OZU (V.O.)
(Grim, tense – expecting trouble)
We’ll soon find out.

DX_M09_0600_DRAGON_2
BLOOD DRAGON 2
(Explosions – hectiv)
Ozu, we’re losing ships left and right. We have to retreat! Good luck!

On the deck of the fortress, several guards appear. One of them scans the shattered horizon for the intruders. Nothing! A garble of orders spills into his headset as he looks again, slowly turning. This time, his field of view is suddenly filled with Ozu’s ship right on top of him. The startled guard tries to react but is too late, Ozu’s blasts cut him down in a blinding flash and an evil hiss of burning flesh. But he doesn’t stop there - Ozu keeps firing. The other guards try to fire back … run – anything ... but they are caught in the insane barrage of Ozu’s firepower, as is pretty much anything else in plain sight on the deck.
Trent arrives on the scene to find Ozu waiting for him, poised for action near the access door. There is no opposition on the smoldering deck. Cautiously, with his weapon drawn, Trent joins Ozu at the door.

DX_S051X_02A01_KU_GUARD_01.WAV
KUSARI GUARD 1
Ahhuhhnnn…

DX_S051X_02B01_KU_GUARD_02.WAV
KUSARI GUARD 2
Uhhhnnn…

DX_S051X_0301_TRENT.WAV
TRENT
Some plan! Just shoot everything. I could have done that myself.

Ozu is only half listening to Trent. As if waiting for an unheard cue Ozu leans back, suddenly flings open the door and reaching his weapon around the jam, fires rapidly and blindly down the hall -- a blaze of hell for anyone unlucky enough to be standing there. Finally, he stops. Silence! Trent is speechless, having not fired a single shot. Ozu slowly looks around the corner, through the smoke, and makes out several guards lying in a heap on the floor. A satisfied Ozu looks back at Trent.

DX_S051X_0401_OZU.WAV
OZU
Sometimes the simplest solutions are the best.

Ozu enters, stepping over the bodies stacked like cord wood. Trent reluctantly follows.

SCENE:	S051XB –INT. TEKAGI’S PLANETARY ARCH BASE – SANCTUM HALLWAY

As the atmosphere clears, Trent and Ozu make their way down the hall, still searching for contacts. They discover several possible doors and paths, but a particularly ornate door appears at the end of the corridor. Without a word, Ozu indicates to Trent that’s where they’re going. Trent nods his understanding and they pad forward. 
They approach the door - Ozu listens as Trent covers him. Ozu shakes his head. It’s clear. Trent reaches for the handle. PSSST. It opens by itself - causing Trent to raise his weapon. The doors open widely inward. They scan they room - No one is there. Trent and Ozu step into the room slowly.

SCENE:	S051XC –INT. TEKAGI’S PLANETARY ARCH BASE – SANCTUM

Still from the doorway, Trent lowers his weapon as his breath is taken way by what he sees: Tekagi’s sanctum is a delicate coalescence of steel, glass and force fields - all held aloft above a swirling energy conduit. Like the eye of a hurricane, there is a palpable peace amid the chaos and confusion of the energy nexus... A peace that is only accentuated by the backdrop of the stratosphere in the distance; A long ornate table stretches in front of Trent’s vision, upon which rests a small shrine, for lack of a better word. Trent glances over to Ozu.

DX_S051X_0502_TRENT.WAV
TRENT
(Serious)
The Tome?

Ozu seems to know what he’s looking for. He nods at the shrine and the thin cylinder resting on it.

DX_S051X_0702_OZU.WAV
OZU
(Spotting the tome)
There!

Trent walks over to it, between a couple of well-appointed chairs, and slowly picks it up. He gazes at the Tome in his hands as Ozu walks deeper into the room, searching. Trent is too consumed with the Tome to notice as Ozu puts his weapon on the table and crouches near its far corner. Ozu moves like a man with a mission.  With his back to Trent, Ozu reaches into his jacket pocket and produces a small device and adjusts a couple of switches on its face. A light comes on followed by the sound of a charging capacitor. Ozu deftly reaches under the table.

DX_S051X_8202_TRENT.WAV
TRENT
(Without looking up – darkly triumphant)
Now for Tekagi…

Ozu affixes THE BOMB to the underside of the table and stands back up with the trigger mechanism in his hand. He reaches for his gun.

DX_S051X_0901_OZU.WAV
OZU
Think it will be that easy, do you?

DX_S051X_1001_TRENT.WAV
TRENT
Well as you said, “sometimes the simplest solutions …”

CLICK-CLACK! A heavy sounding door lock engages and the room is filled with the sound of escaping gas. Ozu knows what that smell is.

DX_S051X_10A01_TRENT.WAV
TRENT
What the..?

DX_S051X_1101_OZU.WAV
OZU
Neural gas!

DX_S051X_1202_OZU.WAV
OZU
[Coughing sounds]

Ozu springs forward and tries the door.

DX_S051X_1201_OZU.WAV
OZU
Locked!

DX_S051X_1301_TRENT.WAV
TRENT
Not for long. Stand back. Stand back!

DX_S051X_1302_TRENT.WAV
TRENT
(Coughing)

DX_S051X_1303_TRENT.WAV
TRENT
(Succumbing to the gas)
Uhhh!

Trent pulls Ozu back and points his weapon at the door but both men stagger and fall unconscious before he can act.  Gas fills the room. Trent's world goes black.

LATER - Trent wakes up in a chair at the long table. Across from him is Ozu - still out. He also notices that there are now several VERY WELL ARMED GUARDS pointing their weapons at them.

Tekagi stands in front of the DELICATELY FORCE SHIELDED OBSERVATION DECK, peering into the distant star field through the stratosphere. The energy mass swirls under his gaze. He puts his hand to the shield and it ripples.

DX_S051X_1601_TEKAGI.WAV
TEKAGI
Breathtaking isn’t it?

DX_S051X_1602_TEKAGI.WAV
TEKAGI
I had it constructed especially for my Sanctum.

DX_S051X_1603_TEKAGI.WAV
TEKAGI
It provides a certain peacefulness, don’t you think?

He turns and WE see his face really for the first time.

DX_S051X_1701_TEKAGI.WAV
TEKAGI
It is one of a kind.

He walks over to the seated Trent.

DX_S051X_1801_TEKAGI.WAV
TEKAGI
Much like this…

He points to the titanium cylinder now set back in its shrine in front of Trent. Trent eyes it and the Guards who look itchy. Tekagi slowly moves and stands next to Ozu, facing Trent. He slowly turns Ozu’s as he speaks.

DX_S051X_1901_TEKAGI.WAV
TEKAGI
You and your Black Dragon friend here have broken into my home …

DX_S051X_1902_TEKAGI.WAV
TEKAGI
… and killed me servants.

DX_S051X_1903_TEKAGI.WAV
TEKAGI
To deprive me of the Proteus Tome and my life! Why?

He suddenly turns and savagely backhands Ozu across the face, jarring him awake.

DX_S051X_2001_TEKAGI.WAV
TEKAGI
Why!

DX_S051X_20A01_OZU.WAV
OZU
Unnnhhh…

Trent moves but a Guard's muzzle keeps him in his seat.

DX_S051X_2101_TEKAGI.WAV
TEKAGI
Now, now … keep your seat.

DX_S051X_2102_TEKAGI.WAV
TEKAGI
I wouldn’t want anything bad to happen to you.

DX_S051X_2103_TEKAGI.WAV
TEKAGI
Not until we have had a chance to talk.

Trent is surprised that he does.

DX_S051X_2201_TEKAGI.WAV
TEKAGI
(To his guards)
Leave us.

Tekagi slowly walks to the head of the table again. Trent watches the guards go and close the door behind them. Ozu locks eyes with Trent - who sees that Ozu still has something in his hand - the trigger mechanism. Trent glances to where the bomb was placed. It’s still there. Ozu indicates he’s going to hit the switch. Trent shakes his head. Ozu narrows his eyes and sets his jaw. He’ll hold off for a few moments. Tekagi stands and looks out the force shield into space. Trent tries to cover.

DX_S051X_2301_TRENT.WAV
TRENT
So what’s to keep me from killing you right now and taking the Tome?

Tekagi glances back at Trent. Tekagi indicates the door.

DX_S051X_2402_TEKAGI.WAV
TEKAGI
Besides, I think I’m more than a match for the two of you.

He gets an evil glint in his heavily-lidded eye.

DX_S051X_2501_TEKAGI.WAV
TEKAGI
On the other hand, maybe I should even the odds.

Suddenly, in one move, Tekagi turns and extends his arm - a blade shoots out and impales Ozu. We see it penetrate the back of the chair and his hand fall seemingly lifeless to the side. Trent stands bolt upright in shock.

DX_S051X_2601_TRENT.WAV
TRENT
Ozu!

DX_S051X_2701_TEKAGI.WAV
TEKAGI
(He grins)
You’re right, I feel much safer now!

Trent takes a step towards him, but stops when he sees another blade slowly extend from Tekagi’s sleeve. Tekagi holds it up menacingly and takes a step himself. Trent counters - staying away from him.

DX_S051X_2801_TEKAGI.WAV
TEKAGI
Be sure, Mr. Trent. Do you really know with whom you’re dealing?

With that Tekagi begins to change - his eyes turn white and begin to glow. He laughs. Trent can't believe what he's seeing.

DX_S051X_2901_TEKAGI.WAV
TEKAGI
(Guttural)
You’re going to tell me what I want to know.

DX_S051X_2902_TEKAGI.WAV
TEKAGI
About the Tome, “The Order” … everything!

He scowls and takes another step towards Trent, who is framed against the backdrop of the stratosphere. Suddenly behind Trent a huge shadow appears in the window. Tekagi sees it and freezes in shock. Trent finally turns to see a BLACK SHIP. Trent sees Hakkera in the cockpit.

DX_S051X_3001_TRENT.WAV
TRENT
(To himself)
Hakkera…

Hakkera only says two words which Trent lip reads. WE are in the cockpit with him as he says it.

DX_S051X_3101_HAKKERA.WAV
HAKKERA
Get down.

He jams the trigger. The TWIN BLASTERS open fire from the ship as Trent dives for cover. Collateral fire rips through the center of the room as Tekagi narrowly misses being killed. Guards come pouring in from the doorway only to be cut to ribbons. The ship turns and a door opens as Trent rises - with his ship on hover, Hakkera beckons for Trent to jump. A weak sound is heard from the corner.

DX_S051X_2903_OZU.WAV
OZU
(Dying)
Trent…

Trent sees immediately there is nothing he can do for him -AND HIS FINGER IS POISED ON THE BUTTON. Trent looks at the Tome and reaches for it. A groaning, feral noise makes him turn. It's Tekagi, he's foisting himself up from the floor. Trent is horrified. Tekagi’s eyes glow even more inhumanly.

DX_S051X_3201_TEKAGI.WAV
TEKAGI
(Barely human voice)
Huh? Ahhhhhh!

DX_S051X_3202_TEKAGI.WAV
TEKAGI
(Laughing)
Hahahhahaha!

DX_S051X_3203_TEKAGI.WAV
TEKAGI
(Angry)
Ahhhhhh!

Trent makes the grab for the Tome and runs for the force shield - yelling the whole way. His body penetrates the shield as Tekagi stands impotently in his sanctum. Ozu’s chair slowly turns to face him. Tekagi’s expression is quizzical, Ozu’s is triumphant, but fading fast. Tekagi looks down to see the detonator - and screams his rage. His world explodes, as Trent lands in the hatchway of Hakkera’s ship. It closes.

SCENE:	SPACE RTC 17: START: ARCH MID-GAME

We see Hakkera’s ship emerging from the center of the arch and flying on a pre-set spline path to the docking bay. On the way, we hear Hekkera say…

DX_M09_0600_TRENT
TRENT
(Near panic)
Hakkera! What was that thing!

DX_M09_0610_HAKKERA
HAKKERA
(Tense)
I’ll explain later. The Dragons have lost most of their ships and had to fall back. It’s just you and I, Mr. Trent.

Hakkera’s ship disappears inside the dock of the arch.

SCENE:	SPACE RTC 17: END: ARCH MID-GAME

SCENE:	S051XD –INT. TEKAGI’S PLANETARY ARCH BASE – LANDING DECK

Hakkera’s ship careens up and dips into frame, depositing Trent on the deck next to his ship. Trent is running to his ship.

DX_S051X_3301_HAKKERA
HAKKERA (O.S.)
Quickly! Get to your ship.

The ship automatically launches Trent to space. IN SPACE:

DX_M09_0620_HAKKERA
HAKKERA
(Tense)
We have to get back to Kyoto. I’m sending you the Jump Hole coordinates. Hurry!

OBJECTIVE: GO TO WAYPOINT

Hakkera takes off. As they fly away from the arch and are nearing the nebula, a Kusari Destroyer and a Rheinland Cruiser uncloak almost directly in front of them.

DX_M09_0630_HAKKERA
HAKKERA
(Tense)
Our escape route is blocked. We have to find another way out of here.

Only seconds later, both large ships detonate in huge explosions.

DX_M09_0640_HAKKERA
HAKKERA
(Surprised)
What the…!

It’s Juni and a wing of four Dragons, flying toward the player through the explosions, from the Jump Hole side. They had fired torpedoes into the large ships.

DX_M09_0650_JUNI
JUNI
(Tense)
Got ‘em! That should set them back for a while. We have to get the hell out of here! Come on!

OBJETIVE: GO TO JUMP HOLE

Hakkera is starting to leave.

DX_M09_0660_JUNI
JUNI
Wait! Where’s Ozu?

DX_M09_0670_HAKKERA
HAKKERA
(Depressed)
He didn’t make it.
(A beat)
He sacrificed his life to end Tekagi’s reign.

The wing enters the nebula.

DX_M09_0680_JUNI
JUNI
How?

DX_M09_0690_HAKKERA
HAKKERA
I will explain when we are in Chugoku … 

They reach the Jump Hole without further incident.

DX_M09_0690B_HAKKERA
HAKKERA
We’ve reached the Jump Hole. Mr. Trent, please go first.

OBJECTIVE: TAKE JUMP HOLE TO CHUGOKU

When Hakkera appears in Chugoku:

DX_M09_0700_JUNI
JUNI
Lord Hakkera, what is going on? How did Ozu die?

DX_M09_0710_HAKKERA
HAKKERA
(Slowly)
He was killed by a Nomad. We only know a few things about them. They are a species with the ability to possess humans and have been slowly infiltrating the colonies.

DX_M09_0715_HAKKERA
HAKKERA
(Slowly)
It appears that they are mostly targeting high-ranking government and military officials. Tekagi was one of these people. Up until today, no one had ever seen a Nomad and lived to talk about it.

DX_M09_0720_JUNI
JUNI
How long have you known about these Nomads?

DX_M09_0730_HAKKERA
HAKKERA
Before we ever met! The Order was founded to protect us from the Nomads. About two months ago, a Rheinland expedition to an uncharted planet found “something”. Soon after that, key positions in the Rheinland government were replaced and Rheinland’s politics became more and more aggressive.

DX_M09_0740_HAKKERA
HAKKERA
We believe these Nomads attempted to infiltrate the Liberty government when Admiral Schultzky came to visit Manhattan. We had to prevent this at all costs, which is why we destroyed the Donau.

They reach a range trigger around Kyoto base.

DX_M09_0750_HAKKERA
HAKKERA
We can talk about this more later. We’re approaching Kyoto.
(A beat - to the station)
This is Lord Hakkera. We are on approach.

DX_M09_0760_KYOTO
KYOTO
We have been awaiting you for some time, Lord Hakkera. What news do you bring?

DX_M09_0770_HAKKERA
HAKKERA
(With gravity)
Our mission was successful. We have the Proteus Tome and Lord Tekagi is dead.
(A beat - grim)
But we paid a high price for this: Lieutenant Ozu is gone.

DX_M09_0780_KYOTO
KYOTO
(Gravely)
Understood! Long live the Dragons! His sacrifice was not in vain.
(A beat)
You are cleared to land.

OBJECTIVE: LAND ON KYOTO

When the player lands on Kyoto, the following scene automatically plays:

SCENE:	S052X –INT. BLACK DRAGON BASE – LANDING DECK

Hakkera and Trent sit in a booth as Hakkera pours himself a drink.  His hand shakes a bit as he pours.  Trent notices.

DX_S052X_0101_HAKKERA.WAV
HAKKERA
I know this is hard to absorb, Mr. Trent, but Rheinland is not our only enemy in this conflict.

DX_S052X_0102_HAKKERA.WAV
HAKKERA
More sacrifices are being made than you will ever hear in the News.

DX_S052X_0103_HAKKERA.WAV
HAKKERA
Men like Ozu are dying every day.

DX_S052X_0201_TRENT.WAV
TRENT
Can you really be so callous about him being killed like that?

DX_S052X_0301_HAKKERA.WAV
HAKKERA
(Laughing)
He knew the risks.

DX_S052X_0401_TRENT.WAV
TRENT
Well, I didn’t. Why didn’t anyone tell me?

DX_S052X_0501_HAKKERA.WAV
HAKKERA
What! That we are being invaded by an alien force we didn’t understand?

DX_S052X_0502_HAKKERA.WAV
HAKKERA
That we had finally come up against something that was more powerful than our own hubris?

DX_S052X_0503_HAKKERA.WAV
HAKKERA
Hmm? Would that have helped?

Trent weighs this. He'd like to say yes.

DX_S052X_0601_HAKKERA.WAV
HAKKERA
That’s why “The Order” was formed, Trent! The peace that we are fighting for!

DX_S052X_0602_HAKKERA.WAV
HAKKERA
That’s why it was so important for you and brave Ozu …

DX_S052X_0601_HAKKERA.WAV
HAKKERA
… to get that thing at all costs.

He points to the Proteus Tome on the table.

DX_S052X_0701_HAKKERA.WAV
HAKKERA
Because it’s important to the Nomads!

He takes a drink. Trent is silent.

DX_S052X_0801_HAKKERA.WAV
HAKKERA
There, now you know!

DX_S052X_0802_HAKKERA.WAV
HAKKERA
How does it feel, Freelancer?

Hakkera gets up and leaves. Trent stares at his drink. When Trent returns to the Landing Deck of Kyoto station, the following scene automatically plays.

OBJECTIVE: MEET JUNI IN THE BAR

SCENE:	S055A –OFFER – INT. BLACK DRAGON BASE – BAR

Trent enters and sees Hakkera speaking with Juni.

DX_S055A_0101_TRENT.WAV
TRENT
Am I interrupting anything?

DX_S055A_0201_JUNI.WAV
JUNI
No. Lord Hakkera was just telling me about Ozu.

DX_S055A_0202_JUNI.WAV
JUNI
How he died. I’m glad you made it back, though.

DX_S055A_0301_TRENT.WAV
TRENT
Thanks to Lord Hakkera.

DX_S055A_0401_HAKKERA.WAV
HAKKERA
Unnecessary, but there is one thing that I do need your help with … if you are up to it…

After the scene has finished, the MISSION OFFER PANEL appears with more detailed information concerning the mission and offering choices to ACCEPT or DECLINE the mission.

The Offer Panel comes up:

RETRIEVE HAKKERA’S INFORMANT

Objective:	Lord Hakkera’s key informant in Rheinland, Herr Van Claussen, has vital information about the Nomads. It is imperative to extract the informant alive. Fly to New Berlin, find Van Claussen and bring him back to Kusari space.
Difficulty:	Rheinland has declared war on Kusari and the Nomads now have complete control over the Rheinland Military. It will be difficult for anyone to get into the heart of Rheinland territory, but it likely will be harder to get out with a wanted spy on board.
Reward:	The survival of mankind in the colonies.

SCENE:	S055B – ACCEPT – INT. BLACK DRAGON BASE – BAR

DX_S055B_0101_TRENT.WAV
TRENT
I owe you one, Hakkera.

DX_S055B_0201_HAKKERA.WAV
HAKKERA
Fine.

DX_S055B_0202_HAKKERA.WAV
HAKKERA
Do you remember when we first met and I had lost contact with an operative of mine in Rheinland?

DX_S055B_0301_TRENT.WAV
TRENT
(Slowly)
Yeah?

DX_S055B_0401_HAKKERA.WAV
HAKKERA
His name is Van Claussen. He is an agent for “The Order” who operates deep in Rheinland space.

DX_S055B_0402_HAKKERA.WAV
HAKKERA
He apparently has discovered vital information about Rheinland’s plans.

DX_S055B_0403_HAKKERA.WAV
HAKKERA
But we’ve had trouble contacting him. He is in terrible danger.

DX_S055B_0404_HAKKERA.WAV
HAKKERA
His only chance is to be “extracted”.

DX_S055B_0501_TRENT.WAV
TRENT
From Rheinland?

DX_S055B_0601_HAKKERA.WAV
HAKKERA
New Berlin. You’re perfect for the job because Bretonia is still neutral.

DX_S055B_0602_HAKKERA.WAV
HAKKERA
I would ask Mss Zane to go, but for obvious reasons that would be inappropriate.

DX_S055B_0701_TRENT.WAV
TRENT
(Slowly – realizing she’s Kusari)
Right!

DX_S055B_0801_HAKKERA.WAV
HAKKERA
And besides, I am sending her back with the Proteus Tome to Doctor Quintaine.

DX_S055B_0802_HAKKERA.WAV
HAKKERA
You must leave at once, Mr. Trent. I will make sure you have all the information you may need. Come along, Jun’ko.

Hakkera walks off with Juni in tow. She turns back to Trent for a moment and freezes - they look at each other on the deck. She then runs back up to him and kisses his cheek quickly --a startling move for her.

DX_S055B_0901_JUNI.WAV
JUNI
Good luck.

She tries to catch up with Hakkera.

DX_S055B_1001_HAKKERA.WAV
HAKKERA
(Calling back)
Jun’ko! Come on!

Trent smiles despite the danger.

SCENE:	S055C – DECLINE – INT. BLACK DRAGON BASE – BAR

DX_S055C_0101_TRENT.WAV
TRENT
Hakkera, I need some time.

DX_S055C_0201_HAKKERA.WAV
HAKKERA
That is one commodity we do no have. However …

DX_S055C_0202_HAKKERA.WAV
HAKKERA
I believe that you are Von Claussen’s best chance of survival, so I will wait until you are ready.

Trent looks at them both, he gets it.  He nods and steps out of frame.

SCENE:	S055D – REOFFER – INT. BLACK DRAGON BASE – BAR

Trent enters the picture again.  Hakkera and Juni look up.

DX_S055D_0201_HAKKERA.WAV
HAKKERA
So! Have you decided to help me after all?

Hakkera studies Trent.

DX_S055D_0101_TRENT.WAV
TRENT
Alright, Hakkera, I’m here. Partly thanks to you. What did you have in mind?

After the scene has finished, the MISSION OFFER PANEL appears with more detailed information concerning the mission and offering choices to ACCEPT or DECLINE the mission.

OBJECTIVE: LAUNCH TO SPACE

When Trent appears in space, he is greeted by HAKKERA and another Blood Dragon pilot, the scout COBO, a serious but young officer.

DX_M10_1000_HAKKERA
HAKKERA
Trent – change of plans. Follow me.

OBJECTIVE: FOLLOW HAKKERA

Hakkera and Cobo begin to fly toward the Jump Hole to Sigma 13, which is galactic north from the Blood Dragon base.

DX_M10_1010_HAKKERA
HAKKERA
We just got news that Rheinland has invaded the Sigma systems. All bases and Jump Gates there are now under Rheinland control. But there is another option.

DX_M10_1020_COBO
COBO
The Blood Dragons know of an uncharted Jump Hole in Sigma 13 that can take you all the way to New Berlin if we move quickly. We will escort you there… then you are on your own.

DX_M10_1025_COBO
COBO
We have uploaded the coordinates of the Jump Hole to your Neural Net. Please take the lead.

DX_M10_1026_COBO
COBO
You have uploaded the coordinates to the Jump Hole. Take point, Mr. Trent. We will follow you.

The group comes within scanner range of the Jump Hole. A waypoint appears.

DX_M10_1030_COBO
COBO
Lord Hakkera, we are near the Jump Hole to Sigma 13.

DX_M10_1050_HAKKERA
HAKKERA
Proceed, Cobo.

Cobo goes through the hole without stopping. As soon as he is gone:

OBJECTIVE: Take jump hole to Sigma 13

DX_M10_1060_HAKKERA
HAKKERA
Trent, I will follow you through.

IF the player dallies (warning and fail):

DX_M10_1070_HAKKERA
HAKKERA
There is no time for this, Trent. Take the Jump Hole!

IF player doesn’t take the Jump Hole for x seconds - FAIL

DX_M10_1080_HAKKERA
HAKKERA
You dishonor yourself and the Order. Cobo, come with me.

The party arrives in Sigma 13 at a spot between the central sun and the debris of the Rheinland fleet from the Eighty Years War.

The Jump Hole is several thousand meters above the galactic plane and is located within a nebula.

DX_M10_1090_HAKKERA
HAKKERA
Follow me, Trent. We have to be careful. According to our informants a large Rheinland fleet is amassing in this area.

OBJECTIVE: GO TO WAYPOINT

The three ships fly through the nebula zone for 10-20 seconds until they hit a clearing …and we see a vast Rheinland fleet beneath…

SCENE:	SPACE RTC 18A: SIGMA 13 ARRIVAL – RHEINLAND FLEET

Several thousand meters above the galactic plane – the camera looks from above Trent’s, Hakkera’s and Cobo’s ship – below is the huge Rheinland build-up: some mission-spawned solar objects, fighters, and two Rheinland battleships dominate the scene.

DX_M10_1100_COBO
COBO
(Stunned)
Oh my lord!

DX_M10_1110_HAKKERA
HAKKERA
The reports were accurate. Rheinland seems to be moving their entire Northern Fleet into Sigma.

DX_M10_1120_COBO
COBO
(Realizing)
With the Liberty Fleet advancing into Kepler, Kusari will get crushed in the middle.

DX_M10_1130_HAKKERA
HAKKERA
This is the right hand. Liberty is the left. When the two hands are strong, they will come together to destroy humanity.

Suddenly, several Rheinland fighters change course to intercept them.

DX_M10_1150_HAKKERA
HAKKERA
Trent, the Jump Hole is near. We have to make a run for it!

(Stunned)
What is this place?

DX_M10_1190_HAKKERA
HAKKERA
What you see here are the remains of the decisive battle in the 80-Year War between Rheinland and the GMG. The Jump Hole is directly ahead of us.

The three ships approach the Jump Hole. A waypoint appears nearby. This marks the mission-only Jump Hole that will deposit the player a short distance from New Berlin.

DX_M10_1200_COBO
COBO
This Jump Hole will take you to New Berlin. This is as far as Lord Hakkera and I can go. Kusari citizens in Rheinland are being arrested on sight … or worse.

DX_M10_1210_HAKKERA
HAKKERA
Von Claussen is awaiting you on New Berlin. It is imperative that we bring him out alive. Good luck, Trent.

Cobo and Hakkera fly off in a direction opposite from the player waypoint. 

IF the player dallies (warning):

DX_M10_1220_HAKKERA
HAKKERA
Why are you still in this system, Trent? Von Claussen needs to get out of Rheinland. You must leave while the Jump Hole is still active!

IF player doesn’t take the Jump Hole for x seconds - FAIL

DX_M10_1230_HAKKERA
HAKKERA
(Filtered to sound distant)
The Jump Hole has closed. You dishonor yourself and the Order, Trent.

OBJECTIVE: LAND on PLANET New Berlin

After taking the Jump Hole, the player arrives a short distance from New Berlin.

The area around New Berlin is another revelation. It is apparent that the colony is preparing for war. The area is busy with warcraft and capital ships.

Eventually, then the player lands:

IF the player doesn’t talk to Jonner and Blix on New Berlin after x seconds

DX_M10_1240_HAKKERA
HAKKERA
(Filtered to sound distant - urgent)
Trent, Hakkera here! We hear that Von Claussen’s safe house has been penetrated. He’s on the run! You have to find him quickly!

IF the player doesn’t talk to Jonner and Blix on New Berlin after x seconds - FAIL

DX_M10_1250_HAKKERA
HAKKERA
(Filtered to sound distant - urgent)
This is Hakkera. Trent, you have greatly disappointed me.

OBJECTIVE: LAND ON NEW BERLIN

Trent lands on New Berlin.

SCENE:	S059X –INT. PLANET NEW BERLIN – BAR

The regular New Berlin landing sequence plays.

OBJECTIVE: Locate Von Claussen

Eventually, Trent has to go to the bar. When he enters, Trent sits down at a corner table, still looking for Von Claussen. JONNER and BLIX, a PSI pair, walk up.

DX_S059X_0101_JONNER
JONNER
My good sir, may we interest you in a reading what the future may hold for you?

DX_S059X_0201_TRENT.WAV
TRENT
No thanks.

Blix doesn't take his eyes off of him.

DX_S059X_0301_JONNER.WAV
JONNER
Contact the dearly departed…

Trent shakes his head.

DX_S059X_0401_JONNER.WAV
JONNER
(Finally – to the point)
Help you find someone.

Trent narrows his eyes. Still…

DX_S059X_0501_TRENT.WAV
TRENT
No!

DX_S059X_0601_JONNER.WAV
JONNER
Mr. Blix here is never wrong about such things. He says you’re looking for someone.

DX_S059X_0602_JONNER.WAV
JONNER
For Herr Von Claussen.

DX_S059X_0701_TRENT.WAV
TRENT
Hm! Does he speak for himself?

Blix looks at Jonner, who nods. Blix simply opens his mouth and a MAD cacophony of voices - men, women, children, of all ages and levels of intensity stream out. It's an insane rush. He closes his mouth and it suddenly stops. Jonner looks back at a surprised Trent.

DX_S059X_0801_JONNER.WAV
JONNER
Mr. Blix has connections to sources on a higher plain.

DX_S059X_0901_TRENT.WAV
TRENT
And what about you?

DX_S059X_1001_JONNER.WAV
JONNER
No, not I, sir! I was gifted with being a “listener”.

DX_S059X_1002_JONNER.WAV
JONNER
Together we are the eyes and ears for certain people who are willing to pay for such divine services.

DX_S059X_1003_JONNER.WAV
JONNER
We are in the employ of one such man now. The man you seek.

DX_S059X_1004_JONNER.WAV
JONNER
You see, we have been waiting for you for sometime.

DX_S059X_1101_TRENT.WAV
TRENT
Why?

DX_S059X_1201_JONNER.WAV
JONNER
To deliver a message!

DX_S059X_1202_JONNER.WAV
JONNER
You are to meet Herr Von Claussen on the old terraforming platform on the planet Holstein.

DX_S059X_1203_JONNER.WAV
JONNER
Within the Frankfurt System.

DX_S059X_1301_JONNER.WAV
JONNER
Don’t worry, Mr. Trent. The Gods are smiling upon you.

DX_S059X_1302_JONNER.WAV
JONNER
When you get there the time will be right.

OBJECTIVE: FLY TO FRANKFURT SYSTEM

When the player launches, the objective updates and he is approached by a Rheinland freighter.

DX_M10_1260_FISCHER
HANS FISCHER
I’m Hans Fischer, a friend of Mr. Blix. He asked me to accompany you on your way to Holstein. Follow me.

DX_M10_1265_FISCHER
HANS FISCHER
I have uploaded a set of coordinates to your Neural Net. Please go ahead and take the lead. I will follow you.

OBJECTIVE: TAKE TRADE LANE TO JUMP GATE

DX_M10_1270_FISCHER
HANS FISCHER
We’re taking the Trade Lane to the Frankfurt Gate.

DX_M10_1280_FISCHER
HANS FISCHER
I’m also a good friend of Herr Von Claussen. He and I have been providing Lord Hakkera with information ever since the Nomads infiltrated the Rheinland government.

When the two ships arrive at the Frankfurt Jump Gate, they see two Rheinland Battleships guarding the Gate. When they approach the Gate, one of the Battleships hails them. The gate is locked until the conversation completes.

DX_M10_1290_BATTLESHIP_FREYA
BATTLESHIP FREYA
This is Battleship Freya! Identify yourselves.

DX_M10_1300_FISCHER
HANS FISCHER
Freya, this is the Daumann Freighter DHC-3417. We’re transporting supplies to Planet Holstein.

DX_M10_1310_BATTLESHIP_FREYA
BATTLESHIP FREYA
Acknowledged! DHC-3417, you’re cleared to proceed.

DX_M10_1320_FISCHER
HANS FISCHER
Mr. Trent, please go first.

OBJECTIVE: TAKE JUMP GATE TO FRANKFURT

Shortly after the player appears in Frankfurt, Fischer’s ship emerges from the Jump Gate.

DX_M10_1330_FISCHER
HANS FISCHER
We’re not far now. Follow me into the Trade Lane.

DX_M10_1330B_FISCHER
HANS FISCHER
Take the Trade Lane.

OBJECTIVE: TAKE TRADE LANE TO MANNHEIM

When they emerge from the Trade Lane, Mannheim station is surrounded by three Rheinland Gunships.

DX_M10_1340_FISCHER
HANS FISCHER
The Rheinland Military has been brutally suppressing any and all opposition to the war with Kusari. We’re about to pass by Mannheim Station. Word is that the military has detained hundreds of journalists and activists there … nobody knows if they’re alive or dead.

OBJECTIVE: Take the tradelanes to planet holstein

DX_M10_1350_FISCHER
HANS FISCHER
We’re coming up on Holstein. It’s the water planet on our right. So far so good!

When they come out of the Trade Lane, more Rheinland Military ships are parked near the Mainz storage depot.

DX_M10_1360_HAKKERA
HAKKERA
(Very distant filter)
Trent, this is Hakkera. We have a slight change to our extraction plan. It is no longer possible for you to return to Kusari. The Rheinland fleet has invaded Honshu. We will rendezvous with you in the Hamburg System. I will transmit precise coordinates later. Hakkera out!

DX_M10_1370_FISCHER
HANS FISCHER
Here we are. Give my regards to Herr Von Claussen. I've got a rendezvous with a Bundschuh agent on the southwestern continent.

OBJECTIVE: Land on Holstein

On reaching the planet, the objective updates as above.

SCENE:	S062X –EXT. PLANET HOLSTEIN

The regular Holstein landing sequence plays and Trent’s ship flies over the water surface and finally reaches the platform. After Trent's ship lands, he faces the high winds and rain. A Rheinland fighter sits off to one side and under an overhang stands MARKUS VON CLAUSSEN, 40s, bald, mustached, a vision of aristocratic finery, warming himself by a fire.

DX_S062X_0101_VONCLAUSSN
VON CLAUSSEN
Are you Mr. Trent?

DX_S062X_0201_TRENT
TRENT
Von Claussen…

DX_S062X_0301_VONCLAUSSN
VON CLAUSSEN
You weren’t followed, were you?

DX_S062X_0401_TRENT
TRENT
I don’t think so.

DX_S062X_0101_VONCLAUSSN
VON CLAUSSEN
Good. I can’t say how pleased I am to see you. Jonner and Blix told me you were coming.

Von Claussen shakes hands with him warmly.

DX_S062X_0601_TRENT
TRENT
Interesting pair!

DX_S062X_0701_VONCLAUSSN
VON CLAUSSEN
A man in my position can never be too careful.

DX_S062X_0702_VONCLAUSSN
VON CLAUSSEN
Blix took the liberty of reading your thoughts while you were on New Berlin.

DX_S062X_0703_VONCLAUSSN
VON CLAUSSEN
I’m sorry for the intrusion. I had to be sure that whoever Hakkera sent had not been tampered with.

DX_S062X_0801_TRENT
TRENT
I understand. Now, let’s get you out of here while we still can.

DX_S062X_0901_VONCLAUSSN
VON CLAUSSEN
No argument here, Mr. Trent?

Both men make for their ships and lift off.  Auto-launch!

SCENE:	SPACE RTC 19: START – HOLSTEIN LAUNCH

The two ships enter space above the water planet. The fly around the planet toward the asteroid base that houses the Bundschuh base:

DX_M10_1380_TRENT
TRENT
Right before I landed on Holstein, Hakkera told me that there’s a change of plans. The Order will send ships to meet us in the Hamburg System.

DX_M10_0160_VONCLAUSSN
VON CLAUSSEN
Perfect! That fits well into my plans. I have a piece of unfinished business I want to take care of. We have to fly to a nearby rebel base. Follow me.

SCENE:	SPACE RTC 19: END – HOLSTEIN LAUNCH

OBJECTIVE: Follow Von Claussen

When the set scene terminates, Von Claussen continues.

DX_M10_0250_VONCLAUSSN
VON CLAUSSEN
An informant recently supplied me with construction blueprints for a new type of vessel being built by the Rheinland Military. It’s unlike any other ship, Trent. The design is alien.

DX_M10_0260_VONCLAUSSN
VON CLAUSSEN
I have contacted a friend of mine who leads a rebel group that opposes the new Rheinland regime. Their base is not far from here.

After a few more second of flying, they can see that the Bundschuh base is under attack by Rheinland forces.

On reaching the base, the objective updates as above and two wings of ships spawn and begin to fight: three Rheinland Navy fighters and three Bundschuh Borderworld fighters.

DX_M10_0190_BUNDBASE
BUNDBASE
…under attack! This is Bundschuh station Bruchsal. All friendly units, please respond!

DX_M10_0200_VONCLAUSSN
VON CLAUSSEN
This is Von Claussen. We are engaging the Rheinlanders.

OBJECTIVE: DefenD Bruchsal base

DX_M10_0205_BUNDBASE
BUNDBASE
(Somewhat relieved)
Herr Von Claussen! Excellent!

The second time a Bundschuh fighter dies:

DX_M10_0210_VONCLAUSSN
VON CLAUSSEN
Another friendly down!

The last Bundschuh fighter dies:

DX_M10_0213_VONCLAUSSN
VON CLAUSSEN
(Intense)
They’ve destroyed all friendly fighters.

Forty to fifty-five seconds after the initial attack occurs, two to three more Rheinland Military fighters appear and attack:

DX_M10_0230_BUNDBASE
BUNDBASE
Scanners are picking up another wing of Rheinland fighters!

When the next-to-last hostile is destroyed:

DX_M10_0233_BUNDBASE
BUNDBASE
One hostile remains!

DX_M10_0235_VONCLAUSSN
VON CLAUSSEN
And still he attacks!
(To Nomad)
Rheinlander! Don’t you see?
(A beat – plainly, no threat)
Today you will die.

Once all of the Rheinlanders are all eliminated:

DX_M10_0237_VONCLAUSSN
VON CLAUSSEN
It’s over.

OBJECTIVE: Land on Bruchsal Base

DX_M10_0240_BUNDBASE
BUNDBASE
Herr Von Claussen! The Bundschuh are thankful for your assistance.

DX_M10_0810_VONCLAUSSN
VON CLAUSSEN
You’re welcome. Mr. Trent, go ahead and dock. I will follow.

Trent docks with the pirate base of the Bundschuh.

SCENE:	S063X: INT. BUNDSCHUH PIRATE BASE – LANDING DECK

Trent and Von Claussen approach CLAUS BOTZLER, forty, a proud fighter. Several other pirates are moving back and forth, doing various things. They whisper until they reach Botzler.

DX_S063X_0101_TRENT
TRENT
The Bundschuh? I’ve never heard of them.

DX_S063X_0201_VONCLAUSSN
VON CLAUSSEN
They’re good people, Trent. Good people in a bad land.

DX_S063X_0301_BOTZLER
BOTZLER
Herr Von Claussen, I‘m glad to see you made it. And this must be your “way out”.

DX_S063X_0401_VONCLAUSSN
VON CLAUSSEN
Yes, my savior, Trent.
(To Trent)
This is Claus Botzler.

DX_S063X_0402_VONCLAUSSN
VON CLAUSSEN
Leader of the Bundschuh rebels!
(The two nod – then to Botzler)
How are you holding out?

DX_S063X_0501_BOTZLER
BOTZLER
Very badly, I’m afraid. The Rheinland regulars have been hitting us with everything they’ve got recently.

DX_S063X_0502_BOTZLER
BOTZLER
But we are still ready for you. Our attack wing will meet you both at the rendezvous point as planned.

DX_S063X_0601_VONCLAUSSN
VON CLAUSSEN
Excellent, my friend! Today we will put a stop to the Chancellor’s secret weapon.

Botzler nods and goes off to make ready. Von Claussen watches him go --almost sadly.

DX_S063X_0701_VONCLAUSSN
VON CLAUSSEN
Trent, you have no idea how difficult it was to betray my world in order to save it.

DX_S063X_0801_TRENT
TRENT
No, I don’t. But I am willing to help you finish what you started,

DX_S063X_0901_VONCLAUSSN
VON CLAUSSEN
(Nods his approval)
Thank you.

VERSION 1 (VERSION 2 FOLLOWS ON PAGE 256)

OBJECTIVE: LAUNCH TO SPACE

When Trent appears in space both Botzler and Von Claussen await him.

DX_M10_0241_VONCLAUSSN
VON CLAUSSEN
I’ve been contacted by the Bundschuh Wing Commander. The attack wing is in position … follow me!

OBJECTIVE: FOLLOW VON CLAUSSEN

DX_M10_0270_VONCLAUSSN
VON CLAUSSEN
Trent, according to my sources, the Rheinland Military is attempting to construct two prototypes based on the alien design. We have to destroy them before they are operational. Doing so will hopefully delay their plans to invade the Kusari home world.

As the pair exits the asteroid field, they are hailed by three Rheinland scouts (ace pilots flying heavy fighters):

DX_M10_0310_SCOUT
SCOUT
(Cold and openly hostile)
This is a restricted zone!

DX_M10_0320_SCOUT
(Cold and openly hostile)
SCOUT
What is your business?

DX_M10_0330_VONCLAUSSN
VON CLAUSSEN
(Voice slightly lowered)
Hold your fire, Trent.

DX_M10_0340_VONCLAUSSN
VON CLAUSSEN
(Voice slightly lowered)
And stay close.

DX_M10_0350_VONCLAUSSN
VON CLAUSSEN
(Voice slightly lowered)
We have prepared a little ruse to get us close to the installation.

DX_M10_0360_VONCLAUSSN
VON CLAUSSEN
This is Colonel Viktor Helling.

DX_M10_0370_VONCLAUSSN
VON CLAUSSEN
I'm escorting the Bretonian engineer requested by High Command.

DX_M10_0380_SCOUT
SCOUT
Acknowledged!

DX_M10_0390_SCOUT
SCOUT
High Command is expecting you.

DX_M10_0400_VONCLAUSSN
VON CLAUSSEN
Excellent!

DX_M10_0410_SCOUT
SCOUT
(Very firmly)
HOLD YOUR POSITION.

DX_M10_0420_SCOUT
SCOUT
Stand by for security scan.

DX_M10_0440_SCOUT
SCOUT
(Filtered – fainter – as he speaks to his dispatch)
Yes.
(Pause)
Yes.
(Pause)
Acknowledged! We are en route.

DX_M10_0450_SCOUT
SCOUT
Aborting scan.

DX_M10_0460_SCOUT
SCOUT
(Grudgingly)
You may proceed.

DX_M10_0470_VONCLAUSSN
VON CLAUSSEN
(Chuckle)
Let's continue.

The player and Von Claussen arrive at the rendezvous point outside a dense nebula field where the Rheinland Navy is reportedly constructing the secret weapon at a heavily-guarded shipyard. This point is on the edgeward side of the system, far from the usual access points. Despite this precaution, security is obviously heavy and they are fortunate Von Claussen had a pre-arranged ruse to distract the scouts. At the rendezvous, they see three Bundschuh pirate fighters waiting in formation for them.

IF the player opens fire on the patrols at the shipyard before Von Claussen triggers the surprise, a comm plays:

DX_M10_0520_VONCLAUSSN
VON CLAUSSEN
Trent!

IF the player opened fire on the scouts earlier, it opens up a different branch of action. Von Claussen cruises toward the rendezvous point, leaving the player behind.

DX_M10_0490_VONCLAUSSN
VON CLAUSSEN
What have you done?!?

DX_M10_0500_SCOUT
SCOUT
We have hostiles in sector C-eight!

DX_M10_0510_VONCLAUSSN
VON CLAUSSEN
Our cover is blown. I'm going to the site now, with or without you!

Von Claussen arrives at the rendezvous: IF player has shot at the scouts

DX_M10_0590_VONCLAUSSN
VON CLAUSSEN
Botzler, follow me. Trent blew our cover so we are going in hard and fast.

DX_M10_0593_BOTZLER
BOTZLER
(Angry)
Damn!

DX_M10_0597_VONCLAUSSN
VON CLAUSSEN
Pilots, keep the defenders off us while we hit the target. I'm prepared to overload their comm channel, but it won't stop them long.

Von Claussen arrives at the rendezvous: IF player has shot at the scouts

DX_M10_0530_VONCLAUSSN
VON CLAUSSEN
(Somewhat surprised)
Botzler, you’re here? Good to see you. 

DX_M10_0540_BOTZLER
BOTZLER
(Darkly)
I wouldn’t miss it for the world. We are ready to strike!

DX_M10_0545_VONCLAUSSN
VON CLAUSSEN
Trent and I will go in first. I have a surprise for them. Wait here for my signal.

Von Claussen leads the way into the mists of the dense nebula field. Nothing is visible for a while, and suddenly the mists clear to reveal a massive installation: four shipyards, each large enough to easily accommodate a Liberty battleship, arranged in parallel and linked by two 2000 m-long access beams. At the crux of the beams, another giant beam rises vertically into space. Two wings of Rheinland fighters are patrolling the area (two leader-level light fighters and four standard lights). A Rheinland gunship slowly trolls through space near the berths.

The most remarkable sight in the scene, though, are two magnificent Nomad capital ships moored near the shipyards. These, no doubt, are the Chancellor’s secret weapons.

DX_M10_0550_VONCLAUSSN
VON CLAUSSEN
(Firmly)
Hold your fire, Trent. Our operative removed some simple clamping from their comm. channel. Watch this!

DX_M10_0560_VONCLAUSSN
VON CLAUSSEN
(Louder)
Pilots, help me! What's wrong with my ship?!?

The patrols turn toward Von Claussen and tune to his comm channel.

DX_M10_0800_VONCLAUSSN
VON CLAUSSEN
(Piercing sfx)

DX_M10_0570_RH1
RH1
(Multiple voices react in one WAV)
What--?
Aaah!
My ears!
Unggh!
Damn you!

Von Claussen sends a waypoint directing the player to one of the Nomad vessels.

The patrol fighters start to drift aimlessly in space… but not for long.

DX_M10_0580_VONCLAUSSN
VON CLAUSSEN
Everyone! Concentrate all fire on this target!

OBJECTIVE: Destroy spacedocked alien ship

Von Claussen arrives at the target. He fires his surprise, but its effect is much shorter and with the greater reaction time, the defenders summon two Rheinland heavy fighters to their aid. They come cruising in from the far end of the shipyard area.

DX_M10_0600_VONCLAUSSN
VON CLAUSSEN
Transmitting comm. signal…!
(Piercing sfx)
I see the target. We have to kill one of those vessels immediately!

After the first Bundschuh wingman has died:

DX_M10_0602_BOTZLER
BOTZLER
We’ve lost a pilot!

After the third Bundschuh wingman has died:

DX_M10_0604_BOTZLER
BOTZLER
Another wingman down! It’s just the three of us!

When the first cap ship is destroyed:

DX_M10_0615_BOTZLER
BOTZLER
That’s one! We've got to destroy the second ship and then get out of here! 

OBJECTIVE: Destroy SECOND alien ship

When the second is destroyed, Von Claussen starts to cruise for the previously-discussed Jump Hole with one of the Bundschuh fighters in tow (if he has survived). Soon the party is immersed again in thick mist and only the instruments give them any indication of their destination. The Rheinlanders are undeterred, and their weapons fire occasionally serves as a reminder.

DX_M10_0620_VONCLAUSSN
VON CLAUSSEN
Got it! Let’s go! Sending coordinates to the Jump Hole to Hamburg.

DX_M10_0625_BOTZLER
BOTZLER
Full throttle - let's get out of here!

OBJECTIVE: FOLLOW VON CLAUSSEN

The party arrives at the Jump Hole.

DX_M10_0740_BOTZLER
BOTZLER
Through the Jump Hole, quickly!

OBJECTIVE: Take the jump hole to hamburg

IF the player dallies OR fails to make progress toward the jumphole during this escape sequence:

DX_M10_0820_VONCLAUSSN
VON CLAUSSEN
What are you doing? Dock with the jump hole!

DX_M10_0830_VONCLAUSSN
VON CLAUSSEN
That's it - you're not getting me killed.

The party arrives in Hamburg in the midst of a large asteroid field.

DX_M10_0630_BOTZLER
BOTZLER
We made it! Where are the Order ships?

DX_M10_0631_HAKKERA
HAKKERA
Trent, we read you! Proceed to the following coordinates … we will be there shortly. Be careful, this system is swarming with Rheinlanders.

OBJECTIVE: GO TO Rendezvous POINT

Soon the party approaches the designated meeting location. At a range of 10000 m, the player can see several capital ships and Von Claussen hails them.

DX_M10_0639_VONCLAUSSN
VON CLAUSSEN
We’re  almost at the coordinates. We should see them soon.

When the fleet is in visual range.

DX_M10_0640_VONCLAUSSN
VON CLAUSSEN
There they are! A big formation. Order ships, this is… 
(Pause)
What the?

DX_M10_0645_BOTZLER
BOTZLER
It’s a trap!

The big formation is composed of two Rheinland battleships and two wings of fighters (two leader-level Rheinland lights and two regular Rheinland lights).

Von Claussen wheels his ship around in a panic, looking for an escape route, but after a few moments of flight, five more Rheinland fighters appear on the scanner. Botzler now becomes vulnerable to enemy fire.

OBJECTIVE: ENGAGE HOSTILE SHIPS

DX_M10_0660_VONCLAUSSN
VON CLAUSSEN
We've got hostiles behind us, too. We're boxed in!

The player and Von Claussen engage in chaotic, seemingly-hopeless combat for 60 seconds or until Von Claussen’s hull drops to 80%, whichever comes first. Then Von Claussen calls for assistance using the appropriate comm.:

DX_M10_0680_VONCLAUSSN
VON CLAUSSEN
Cover me! I see an opportunity.

DX_M10_0690_VONCLAUSSN
VON CLAUSSEN
Shields are down. Cover me!

Once Botzler dies (he has to)

DX_M10_0735_VONCLAUSSN
VON CLAUSSEN
Botzler!

SCENE:	SPACE RTC 20: START – OSIRIS UNCLOAKS

We see Trent and Von Claussen travel radical splines as they avoid fire, with the two Rheinland battleships in the background. Suddenly, the Osiris uncloaks in the space between the two battleships and lets loose a hellish barrage of missiles and turret fire. 

DX_M10_0700_VONCLAUSSN
VON CLAUSSEN
What -- !!

After several seconds, one of the battleships explodes in a massive flash and the other starts to smoke. The smoker starts to flee.

DX_M10_0770_HAKKERA
HAKKERA
All turrets, target the battleship!

After a few moments, the second battleship explodes in a gout of flame.

DX_M10_0710_HAKKERA
HAKKERA
This is Hakkera! Trent, Mr. Von Claussen, land quickly. We have to get away before more Rheinland ships enter the area.

Von Claussen and Trent nose toward the Osiris through the burning wreckage. They make their way to the large Battleship and land.

VERSION 2

OBJECTIVE: LAUNCH TO SPACE

SCENE:	SPACE RTC 19B: START – FLY TO SHIPYARD

Trent leaves the base and goes into set scene. He is put into formation with Von Claussen and Botzler’s Wing. They begin to travel to the field at cruise velocity.

DX_M10_0241B_VONCLAUSSN
VON CLAUSSEN
Trent, according to my sources, the Rheinland Military is amassing a fleet at a secret installation not far from here. We must strike this installation in order to slow the growing Rheinland war machine. If we are successful, this strike will greatly delay the Rheinland war plans!

DX_M10_0280B_BOZTLER
BOZTLER
This will not be an easy operation. The installation is surrounded by a radioactive field that has been further reinforced by mines. In addition, there is only one known way in and out of the field, a small passage located to the east of the field. Our scouts report that it is no more than 100 meters wide.

DX_M10_0290B_VONCLAUSSN
VON CLAUSSEN
Our sensors are unable to penetrate the field, so we have no tactical information about fleet positions or even the installation itself. Despite this, we must strike this installation.

DX_M10_0300B_BOZTLER
BOZTLER
Be wary of the narrow passage. The mines are low yield but will still do quite a bit of damage to your ship.

DX_M10_0310B_VONCLAUSSN
VON CLAUSSEN
This operation is vital to the survival of both Rheinland and Kusari. If this war is allowed to progress, none shall survive. Stay alert and await my orders once we reach the end of the passage.

SCENE:	SPACE RTC 19B: END – FLY TO SHIPYARD

DX_M10_0320B_BOZTLER
BOZTLER
We’re here. All fighters break formation!

DX_M10_0330B_VONCLAUSSN
VON CLAUSSEN
Be careful everyone! While the radiation in the field will damage your ship, the mine field is significantly more deadly. Stay calm and fly right. Let’s go.

OBJECTIVE: FLY INTO THE PASSAGE

Once they are inside the passage: As they pass through the passage, various members of Botzler’s wing don’t quite make it.

DX_M10_0340B_BUNDSCHUH_A
BUNDSCHUH A
Can’t keep it together…! (Explosion)

DX_M10_0350B_BUNDSCHUH_B
BUNDSCHUH B
My stabilizers! … (Explosion)

DX_M10_0360B_BUNDSCHUH_C
BUNDSCHUH C
Long live … (Explosion)

DX_M10_0361B_VONCLAUSSN
VON CLAUSSEN
Sensors show the passage is opening up into a huge open area. We’re also picking up a massive installation. That will be our target.

DX_M10_0362B_BOTZLER
BOZTLER
All fighters, arm weapons and prepare to engage on passage exit!

DX_M10_0363B_VONCLAUSSN
VON CLAUSSEN
For the sake of peace, that installation must fall … at all costs.

They are exiting the passage. Only Botzler, two Bundschuh fighters, Von Claussen and Trent remain. Everyone is moderately damaged from the radiation field. As the field expands into an exclusion zone, what you see is breathtaking. A military shipyard with two very alien, very large ships moored and a full Rheinland Military fleet. Unfortunately, there is no time to take this in, since when you exited the field, there was a battleship and a full fighter escort there to shake your hand.

DX_M10_0370B_VONCLAUSSN
VON CLAUSSEN
All remaining fighters! Break and hit the installation. Hit whatever you can!

DX_M10_0380B_BOTZLER
BOTZLER
Herr Von Claussen, I’m picking up another passage on the far side of the interior, we must use this passage as our means of escape. We will not survive a head on fight with the capitol ships.

DX_M10_0381B_VONCLAUSSN
VON CLAUSSEN
Sensors indicate that those are battleship-class Nomads moored with the station. If we take out the station, those vessels will be destroyed as well.

DX_M10_0382B_BUNDSCHUH_D
BUNDSCHUH D
Herr Botzler, the Rheinland battleships are keeping us away from the installation. We can’t get a good shot.

DX_M10_0383B_BOTZLER
BOTZLER
Keep trying! That station must fall! Those Nomad battleships must NOT be allowed to survive!

DX_M10_0390B_VONCLAUSSN
VON CLAUSSEN
All fighters! Hit the installation with everything you have!

During the course of the battle, the remaining fighters (2) of Botzler’s wing are killed off trying to strike the installation.

DX_M10_0400B_BUNDSCHUH_D
BUNDSCHUH D
Can’t stay on target … (Explosion)

DX_M10_0401B_BOTZLER
BOTZLER
This act will NOT go unpunished!

After about 30 seconds of intense fighting:

DX_M10_0402B_VONCLAUSSN
VON CLAUSSEN
We simply can’t do enough damage to the installation!

DX_M10_0403B_BOTZLER
BOTZLER
My wing has been destroyed.


DX_M10_0410B_BUNDSCHUH_E
BUNDSCHUH_E
Too many fighters, can’t shake … (Explosion)

Finally, after from 30 seconds to a minute of very intense fighting…

DX_M10_0420B_VONCLAUSSN
VON CLAUSSEN
No time left, we’ve got to get out of here. We’ve done everything we can! Our best hope now is to warn Kusari of this fleet.

DX_M10_0430B_BOTZLER
BOTZLER
No! My men will NOT have died in vain!

DX_M10_0440B_VONCLAUSSN
VON CLAUSSEN
Botzler!

DX_M10_0450B_BOTZLER
BOTZLER
Just go and tell your compatriots what you’ve seen and what awaits them! Go! While there’s still time!

Botzler then breaks off and heads to the installation, all weapons spitting fire.

DX_M10_0460B_BOTZLER
BOTZLER
For Rheinland!!!

Botzler suicides himself into the station, which explodes in glorious fury.

DX_M10_0461B_VONCLAUSSN
VON CLAUSSEN
NOOOOO!

DX_M10_0470B_VONCLAUSSN
VON CLAUSSEN
Goodbye, old friend and god speed!

The Rheinland fleet is now wheeling towards you and Von Claussen.

DX_M10_0480B_VONCLAUSSN
VON CLAUSSEN
Trent, we’ve got to go now. We can’t let Botzler’s sacrifice be in vain.

IF not making forward progress after 15 seconds

DX_M10_0490B_VONCLAUSSN
VON CLAUSSEN
Trent! Let’s go! Now!

IF not making forward progress after 30 seconds

DX_M10_0500B_VONCLAUSSN
VON CLAUSSEN
Trent! I can’t wait for you. I’m heading for the exit passage. I will meet you on the other side.

Von Claussen sends a comm. once he is within 2000m of the Jump Hole

DX_M10_0501B_VONCLAUSSN
VON CLAUSSEN
Trent, there’s only one way out of here. I’ve uploaded the coordinates. Follow me!

DX_M10_0502B_VONCLAUSSN
VON CLAUSSEN
I’m reading a Jump Hole ahead!

DX_M10_0503B_VONCLAUSSN
VON CLAUSSEN
(Ecstatic)
There, the Jump Hole! Navigation systems indicate that it leads to the Hamburg System. That is our way out, Trent!

Von Claussen waits for Trent at the Jump Hole if he left the installation first

DX_M10_0504B_VONCLAUSSN
VON CLAUSSEN
Excellent! You made it! Come on, Trent. We have to get out of here before more Rheinland ships come after us. Take the Jump Hole.

Von Claussen and Trent jump to Hamburg at the end of the passage. On the other side, they find a single battleship blockading their escape.  

SCENE:	SPACE RTC 20: START – OSIRIS UNCLOAKS

Immediately after they arrive in Hamburg, the two ships are greeted by a giant Rheinland battleship.

DX_M10_0700_VONCLAUSSN
VON CLAUSSEN
What -- !!

Immediately after the comm., the Osiris uncloaks broadside to the Rheinland battleship as well as several wings of Border World Super Heavy’s (Blood Dragons), they all immediately open fire on the Rheinland battleship.

DX_M10_0770_HAKKERA
HAKKERA
All turrets, target the battleship!

After a few moments, the second battleship explodes in a gout of flame.

DX_M10_0710_HAKKERA
HAKKERA
This is Hakkera! Trent, Mr. Von Claussen, land quickly. We have to get away before more Rheinland ships enter the area.

Von Claussen and Trent nose toward the Osiris through the burning wreckage. They make their way to the large Battleship and land.

SCENE:	S064XA – INT. ORDER BATTLESHIP OSIRIS – LANDING DECK

ALL of the ships land. Trent emerges from his ship and looks around. He never knew "The Order" had these resources or technology. Men and ships move around the deck.

DX_S064X_0101_JUNI
JUNI
Impressive, isn’t it? I’m glad you’re here to see it. I thought we’d lost you back there.

DX_S064X_0201_TRENT
TRENT
Juni, you’re here. How did you…?

DX_S064X_0301_JUNI
JUNI
We had to move the operation. The artifacts, the research … everything!

DX_S064X_0302_JUNI
JUNI
Quintaine and Sinclair are conferring with Orillion now…

DX_S064X_0401_TRENT
TRENT
Orillion?

DX_S064X_0501_JUNI
JUNI
Yes, Trent. This is his flagship.

Trent looks around again as Von Claussen appears behind Trent from the ship.

DX_S064X_0601_JUNI
JUNI
And this must be …

DX_S064X_0701_HAKKERA
HAKKERA (O.S.)
Herr von Claussen!

They both turn to see Hakkera walking to greet them.  He shakes Von Claussen's hand. He is pleased.

DX_S064X_0801_HAKKERA
HAKKERA
You’re here at last. Do you have the plans?

DX_S064X_0901_VONCLAUSSN
VON CLAUSSEN
I do, thanks to Mr. Trent. My compliments, Hakkera …

DX_S064X_0901_VONCLAUSSN
VON CLAUSSEN
… he is a fine addition to your group. You should make him a Colonel.
(To Trent)
Thank you, again.

Hakkera nods his approval to Trent and leads Von Claussen off.

DX_S064X_1001_JUNI
JUNI
Come on, “Colonel”. It’s time I reacquainted you with an old friend.

She leads him to…

SCENE:	S064XB – INT. ORDER BATTLESHIP OSIRIS – BAR

The Order lounge is a mix of various people, all in the midst of their duties. Juni walks Trent in. He is immediately recognized by King.

DX_S064X_1101_KING
KING
Trent!

DX_S064X_1201_TRENT
TRENT
King! You’re here, too?

DX_S064X_1301_KING
KING
A lot of us are. Welcome aboard the “Osiris”.

DX_S064X_1302_KING
KING
A fine piece of hardware from the Liberty Naval labs.

DX_S064X_1401_TRENT
TRENT
This is a Liberty ship?

DX_S064X_1501_JUNI
JUNI
It was. It’s an advanced prototype they never had the chance to use.

DX_S064X_1502_JUNI
JUNI
“The Order” commandeered her right out from under their noses.

DX_S064X_1601_TRENT
TRENT
Who makes off with an entire ship without getting caught?

Juni recognizes someone behind Trent. Trent turns and looks into the face of CASPER ORILLION, 45, strong, bald, like Yul Brenner and Jean Reno. A cigarette dangles from his mouth.

DX_S064X_1701_ORILLION
ORILLION
I do, Mr. Trent.

DX_S064X_1702_ORILLION
ORILLION
My name is Casper Orillion. Welcome to the “Osiris” and to “The Order”.

Trent is speechless.

LATER! ANGLE ON: Drink being poured. Juni sits with them.

DX_S064X_1801_TRENT
TRENT
So, Mr. Orillion, you used to work for Liberty?

ANGLE ON: Orillion pouring.

DX_S064X_1901_ORILLION
ORILLION
(Pouring … matter-of-factly)
For their deepest darkest. I was their top agent until I discovered the Nomads had taken over my CO.

DX_S064X_1902_ORILLION
ORILLION
They wanted me too, but I managed to escape aboard this ship.

DX_S064X_1903_ORILLION
ORILLION
That’s when I committed myself to learning everything I could about the Nomads and their plan.

DX_S064X_1904_ORILLION
ORILLION
I surrounded myself with recruits from all over the colonies.

DX_S064X_1905_ORILLION
ORILLION
People like you two, to help rid us of the infestation.

DX_S064X_2001_TRENT
TRENT
You mean the Nomads.

DX_S064X_2101_ORILLION
ORILLION
That’s right. They’ve been taking over human beings from some time now; controlling them.

DX_S064X_2102_ORILLION
ORILLION
As near as we can tell, this all started when a Rheinland survey team discovered an uncharted planet.

DX_S064X_2103_ORILLION
ORILLION
One that no human had ever set foot on! Unfortunately, when they penetrated its crust...

DX_S064X_2104_ORILLION
ORILLION
…the inhabitants that lived inside viewed us as a threat.

DX_S064X_2201_TRENT
TRENT
So why not just attack us outright?

DX_S064X_2301_JUNI
JUNI
Because we’re too strong! They had to soften us up a bit.

DX_S064X_2302_JUNI
JUNI
That’s why the Chancellor started this war in the colonies.

DX_S064X_2401_ORILLION
ORILLION
So when we’re sufficiently thinned out, they can come in and mop up the rest,

DX_S064X_2501_TRENT
TRENT
So the Chancellor is a host body for the Nomads, too!

DX_S064X_2601_ORILLION
ORILLION
Isn’t it obvious? Now if you’ll excuse me, I have a briefing to attend. Colonel Zane?

Trent looks at Juni. "Colonel"?

DX_S064X_2701_JUNI
JUNI
(Smiling like a cat)
Don’t worry, Trent. No need to salute.

She gets up and goes with Orillion as they leave the Lounge. She casts he eye back it Trent. - Gotcha!
Note: In space, the Osiris can receive various Newscasts from different colonies.

SCENE:	S067A: OFFER – INT. ORDER BATTLESHIP OSIRIS – LANDING DECK

Trent walks up to Juni who is standing with King and equipping her ship.

DX_S067A_0101_TRENT
TRENT
What’s happening here?

DX_S067A_0201_KING
KING
More of the same! 

Orillion and Lord Hakkera come walking up with purpose.

DX_S067A_0301_ORILLION
ORILLION (O.S.)
Colonel Zane!

This gets Juni's attention.  She turns.

DX_S067A_0401_JUNI
JUNI
Sir!

DX_S067A_0501_ORILLION
ORILLION
We’ve just gotten word that President Jacobi is still alive. I need you and Colonel Trent for a mission at once.

Juni looks over at Trent.

DX_S067A_0701_ORILLION
ORILLION
Are you ready for this?

After the scene has finished, the MISSION OFFER PANEL appears with more detailed information concerning the mission and offering choices to ACCEPT or DECLINE the mission.

SCENE:	S067B: ACCEPT – INT. ORDER BATTLESHIP OSIRIS – LANDING DECK

DX_S067B_0101_TRENT
TRENT
Ready.

DX_S067B_0201_ORILLION
ORILLION
Good. A loyal group of LSF members have apparently survived…

DX_S067B_0202_ORILLION
ORILLION
…and have monitored the President since her abduction. She’s being held in the Alaska System.

DX_S067B_0501_TRENT
TRENT
So now the Nomads have her?

DX_S067B_0601_JUNI
JUNI
What’s her status?

DX_S067B_0801_ORILLION
ORILLION
Unknown, but I want you to find out.

DX_S067B_0802_ORILLION
ORILLION
Rescue or terminate. Do you understand?

DX_S067B_0901_JUNI
JUNI
Yes, Sir!

DX_S067B_1001_ORILLION
ORILLION
Good. You are to hook up with the leader of these LSF operatives. A man named Walker.

DX_S067B_1101_JUNI
JUNI
Marcus Walker? He’s alive?

DX_S067B_1201_ORILLION
ORILLION
You know him?

DX_S067B_1301_JUNI
JUNI
We both do.

DX_S067B_1401_ORILLION
ORILLION
Then good luck!

He turns and leaves. Hakkera stays behind and speaks to Trent.

DX_S067B_1501_HAKKERA
HAKKERA
I wanted to come and say goodbye myself.

DX_S067B_1601_TRENT
TRENT
You’re leaving?

DX_S067B_1701_HAKKERA
HAKKERA
Something for Orillion! I will see you again.

He leaves.

DX_S067B_1801_TRENT
TRENT
(To himself)
Goodbye.

DX_S067B_1901_JUNI
JUNI
Come on, Trent. It’s time to rescue the President.

DX_S067B_2001_KING
KING
We’re back in business!

They all exit frame.

SCENE:	S067C: DECLINE – INT. ORDER BATTLESHIP OSIRIS – LANDING DECK

DX_S067C_0101_TRENT
TRENT
No, I’m not.

DX_S067C_0201_ORILLION
ORILLION
Well, you better get ready. We need you now, Trent.

This gets Trent's attention.

DX_S067C_0301_TRENT
TRENT
I won’t be long.

He exits frame.

SCENE:	S067D: REOFFER – INT. ORDER BATTLESHIP OSIRIS – LANDING DECK

Juni stands on the deck with King, Hakkera and Orillion as Trent steps into frame.

DX_S067D_0101_ORILLION
ORILLION
Well, Mr. Trent. I’m glad to see you’ve come to your senses. The President is waiting. Are you ready now?

After the scene has finished, the MISSION OFFER PANEL appears with more detailed information concerning the mission and offering choices to ACCEPT or DECLINE the mission.

OBJECTIVE: LAUNCH TO SPACE


On launch, the player finds Juni and King waiting for him just outside the Osiris’ docking bay. The current system is Texas; this is as close to New York as Orillion feels is safe. 

The Osiris is conveniently located only a few thousand meters from the Jump Hole to the New York Badlands.

DX_M11_0100_JUNI
JUNI
There you are. Follow King and I.

DX_M11_0101_JUNI
JUNI
There you are. I’ve uploaded the coordinates to the Jump Hole. Trent, take the lead. King and I will follow you. Let’s go.

OBJECTIVE: GO TO Jump HOLE to Texas

DX_M11_0110_ORILLION
ORILLION
Colonel Zane, I am hoping you can bring Jacobi back alive. You know how important she will be for the Order in the days ahead.

DX_M11_0120_JUNI
JUNI
Yes, sir.

DX_M11_0130_ORILLION
ORILLION
This is as far as the Osiris can take you. The Jump Hole to the New York Badlands is in the debris field a short distance from here. You will meet Walker at Buffalo inside the Badlands. Orillion out!

DX_M11_0140_KING
KING
(Happy)
I can’t believe Walker is still alive! It’ll be good to see him again.

The group flies into the debris field.

DX_M11_0150_JUNI
JUNI
I’d started to fear the worst.

DX_M11_0160_KING
KING
Me, too. I can’t wait to hear his story.

DX_M11_0165_JUNI
JUNI
After he helped us escape from Manhattan, I’m sure the entire Liberty Navy was after him.

They reach a area trigger around the Jump Hole.

DX_M11_0170_JUNI
JUNI
There’s the Jump Hole now.

DX_M11_0180_KING
KING
You first, Trent.
(A beat)
I wouldn’t be surprised if the Navy is guarding all the Jump Holes into New York by now.

OBJECTIVE: TAKE Jump HOLE to Texas

IF the player misbehaves, we have a warning comm. These lines are reused at the prison station:

DX_M11_0190_KING
KING
We’re waiting for you, Trent. Time is short.

IF the player misbehaves even longer, we fail the mission. These lines are reused at the prison station:

DX_M11_0200_KING
KING
That‘s it, Trent. You’re obviously not ready for this mission.

The party jumps through the Jump Hole and arrives back in New York. On the New York side, the Jump Hole to Texas is located in the Badlands, toward the galactic-south side of the field. Upon arrival, the party sees two Liberty Heavy Fighters, sitting still not far from the Jump Hole. They are red on the contact list but they do not move.

DX_M11_1660_JUNI
JUNI
(Alerted)
There! Navy Fighters!

OBJECTIVE: DESTROY HOSTILES

King and Juni turn around slowly to approach the hostiles and then attack, giving the player the chance to take the lead. When any of the friendlies gets within 750 m, the two ships explode.

DX_M11_1665_JUNI
JUNI
It’s an ambush. Take these guys out!

Three leader-level LPI light fighters, two Rheinland gunboats, and one ace-level Navy heavy fighter uncloak around the party.

DX_M11_1680_KING
KING
(Stressed)
Liberty ships, with cloaking devices!

DX_M11_1681_NAVY_ACE
NAVY ACE
(Threatening)
Cut your engines or you will be destroyed!

DX_M11_0300_JUNI
JUNI
No way to win this one. We’ve got to run for it! Stay close. King, take the lead.

OBJECTIVE: Follow King to BUFFALO

King spawns a formation and flees into the Badlands, headed for Buffalo Base (Li01_12), a criminal installation in the Badlands, about 11k meters away. The Gunboats cannot follow, but the fighters harass the party as they run for it.

DX_M11_0305_JUNI
JUNI
I don’t think they will follow us. Walker is on Buffalo – a heavily fortified Liberty Rogue base that’s also an Outcast stronghold.

DX_M11_0305B_JUNI
JUNI
Great job, Trent! You take point. We’re headed to Buffalo, a heavily fortified Rogue base. Walker should be waiting for us there.

DX_M11_1690_KING
KING
Liberty Rogues! Reminds me of simpler times…

IF the player lags far behind:
DX_M11_1510_JUNI
JUNI
Trent, what are you doing? We can't wait for you!

Fail:

DX_M11_1550_KING
KING
That’s it. The Nomads are about to kill Jacobi. We’re out of time.

When any of the pursuers gets within 5000m of the criminal base, these comms play:

DX_M11_1555_JUNI
JUNI
Good. My scanner is back online.

DX_M11_1430_NAVY_ACE
NAVY ACE
This is Delta Leader. All units pull back. This sector is too hot for us.

The player sees Buffalo Base materialize dramatically out of the mist. It is built into a large black asteroid and it is locked to the player as the following dialog plays. Several ex-LSF fighters are stationed nearby; their descriptions show they belong to the Order.

DX_M11_0320_KING
KING
Juni, are you seeing this! LSF ships!

DX_M11_0325_LSF
LSF PILOT
Colonel Zane, we’ve been expecting you. Captain Walker is waiting for you inside.

DX_M11_0330_JUNI
JUNI
Thank you.
(A beat)
Trent, you dock first. Pick up some ammo and equipment …I have a feeling we’ll need it to get through this one.

The base unlocks.

IF the player starts to dock with a neutral solar en route:

DX_M11_1570_JUNI
JUNI
You want to take a break? Ok, make it snappy.

DX_M11_1575_KING
KING
Need to make a pit stop? All right, I’ll wait here.

IF the player then makes no progress toward the solar’s docking ring for 30 seconds, if the player forms up on Juni or King, or if the player lands and launches:

DX_M11_0220_JUNI
JUNI
(Terse)
Come on, let's go.

OBJECTIVE: dock with BUFFALO BASE

SCENE:	S068X: INT. BUFFALO – LANDING DECK

Trent, King and Juni land. They are met by Walker and his men.

DX_S068X_0101_JUNI
JUNI
Walker! You son of a …. I thought you were dead!

They greet each other warmly.

DX_S068X_0201_WALKER
WALKER
So did I!

Walker sees Trent and shakes his hand.

DX_S068X_0301_WALKER
WALKER
Trent! Flying for “The Order”!

DX_S068X_0302_WALKER
WALKER
Given up freelancing for a real cause? I’m impressed.

DX_S068X_0401_TRENT
TRENT
It’s the only one worth fighting for now. I hear you’ve got a line on the President.

DX_S068X_0401B_TRENT
TRENT
I hear you’ve got a line on the President.

DX_S068X_0501_WALKER
WALKER
Indeed we do. But we’ll have to hurry.

DX_S068X_0601_JUNI
JUNI
C’mon. Let’s get to work.

They exit frame.

OBJECTIVE: LAUNCH TO SPACE

The player launches. Juni, King, and Walker (in a fighter) are there in space.

DX_M11_1710_JUNI
JUNI
Trent, good. We just received a message from Orillion with new orders. Everybody ready?

DX_M11_1711_WALKER
WALKER
I have to rejoin my attack group on the far side of the Badlands. I’m sorry that I can’t come with you now, but we’ll meet you as planned at Zone 21.

Walker flies off.

DX_M11_1712_JUNI
JUNI
Understood, we’ll see you at the rendezvous. Trent, follow me.

DX_M11_1712B_JUNI
JUNI
Understood, we’ll see you at the rendezvous. Trent, take point.

Juni flies off.

OBJECTIVE: Follow Juni

DX_M11_1713_JUNI
JUNI
There is a Jump Hole nearby that will get us very close to our target.

DX_M11_0340_KING
KING
What’s the target?

DX_M11_1450_JUNI
JUNI
A new specialized satellite that the Navy deployed recently. Our sources say it is designed to detect cloaked ships.

DX_M11_1460_JUNI
JUNI
(Clarifying)
Like the Osiris. If we take out the satellite, Orillion and the Osiris could operate in this system without being detected.

The three ships approach the Jump Hole.

DX_M11_1461_JUNI
JUNI
(Clarifying)
We’re coming up on the Jump Hole … Trent, after you.

OBJECTIVE: TAKE JUMP HOLE

The party comes within radar range of the target and a waypoint appears. Once they appear on the other side:

DX_M11_1462_JUNI
JUNI
The satellite installation is very close. I’m uploading the coordinates to you now. Follow me.

DX_M11_1462B_JUNI
JUNI
The satellite installation is very close. I’m uploading the coordinates to you now. Take the lead, Trent.

OBJECTIVE: GO TO SATELLITE INSTALLATION

After only about 10 sec. of travel:

DX_M11_1463_JUNI
JUNI
My scanner is picking up the satellite.
(A beat - cautious)
I’m not detecting any ships –could be a trap.

DX_M11_1470_KING
KING
Juni, I'm reading multiple weapons platforms directly next to the satellite.

OBJECTIVE: destroy satellite

DX_M11_1471_JUNI
JUNI
Confirmed! Let’s take this thing out quickly.

While the satellite is still active, a wing of three ace-level Navy Fighters attacks:

DX_M11_1480_JUNI
JUNI
(Alerted)
I’m reading three Navy fighters on an intercept course. I’m scrambling their comm. systems, but we have to take them out. If they get away, all of Liberty will be alerted to our presence.

DX_M11_1480B_JUNI
JUNI
(Alerted)
We’ve got Navy fighters on an intercept course. We have to stop these guys.

IF the satellite has been destroyed:

OBJECTIVE: Destroy Hostiles

Hostiles are destroyed:

DX_M11_1500_KING
KING
Good work. Let’s proceed to the rendezvous. We’ve lost enough time here.

OBJECTIVE: RENDEZVOUS WITH WALKER

The party cruises toward the Walker rendezvous point at the mouth of Zone 21.

DX_M11_1730_KING
KING
Juni, what do you know about Alaska? It’s not on any of the Star Charts. All I’ve ever heard were rumors.

DX_M11_1733_JUNI
JUNI
Me, too. The only thing I know for sure is that the Navy has a Jump Gate at the heart of Zone 21. It leads to Alaska. Everything else is rumor or speculation.

DX_M11_1740_KING
KING
I’ve always heard that the Navy is constructing a secret fleet there. I guess we‘ll see with our own eyes soon.

The three ships reach a visible-range trigger… this starts a conversation that sequences as follows: 390, 400, 404, 406, 408, 400.

DX_M11_0390_KING
KING
(Hopeful)
There they are! Two cruisers! Excellent!

This is an alternate line that allows for the conversation to start earlier. The sequence would be 392, 402, 404, 406, 408, 390, 400.

DX_M11_0392_JUNI
JUNI
(Alternate line)
Walker, are you there? We’re on our way.

The player nears Walker’s convoy. Walker is commanding two cruisers, three Liberty light fighters, and four Liberty heavy fighters.

DX_M11_0400_WALKER
WALKER
Roger. Follow me. We’ll be using a set of forged security clearances on the way in.

DX_M11_0401_JUNI
JUNI
We’ll have to fight our way through to the Jump Gate. Trent, you have the lead. Head to the coordinates.

OBJECTIVE: Follow Walker to Zone 21

DX_M11_0402_WALKER
WALKER
(Alternate line)
Acknowledged. We’re already at the rendezvous point.

DX_M11_0404_JUNI
JUNI
Perfect. It’s good to be flying with you again, Walker.

DX_M11_0406_WALKER
WALKER
Thank you, Jun’ko.
(A beat)
A lot has happened since you left Liberty. The democracy we once served is now a bloodthirsty military dictatorship.
(A beat)
My crew and I were forced to leave the central systems. We’ve been prowling the Independent Worlds, destroying Rheinland supply depots. A strange life for a career Navy officer.

DX_M11_0408_JUNI
JUNI
These are strange times.

DX_M11_0410_WALKER
WALKER (alternate line)
True.
(A beat)
Follow me. We’ll be using a set of forged security clearances on the way in.

The party cruises into the short exclusion zone that leads to the heart of Zone 21, the secret vault of the Liberty Navy. All around them is a wall of large metallic mines; the only clear paths are forward and back.

The convoy gets within visual range of a Jump Gate at the center of the minefield. They also are spotted by a formation of four ace-level LSF light fighters, which moves to attack and calls for help. (These must be light fighters to distinguish them from the prototype heavies.)

DX_M11_0420_LSFER
LSFER
Enemy vessels inbound! Omega wing, get those ships over here!

OBJECTIVE: Protect convoy

DX_M11_0430_PROTO1
PROTO1
Powering up the drives now, sir. We’ll take care of them.

DX_M11_0440_LSFER
LSFER
Just do it!

DX_M11_0450_JUNI
JUNI
Moving to intercept. Trent, King, engage the hostiles!

A wing of six prototype fighters (Liberty heavy fighters) begins to cruise toward the convoy from the other side of the Jump Gate. These ships bear some of the most powerful loadouts in the game. They all bear the “Omega-Proto” designation in the contact list.

They get within range of the convoy and unload.

DX_M11_0490_JUNI
JUNI
Holy--! What kind of weapons are they carrying?

DX_M11_0500_WALKER
WALKER
There's no way we can handle this gate with these ships on our backs!

OBJECTIVE: DESTROY PROTOTYPES

Fortunately, the prototypes are not battle-ready. Their flight patterns are periodically disrupted by energy management problems that force them to grind to a halt.


We have incoming hostiles. All units, power up weapons!
Protect the Jump Gate at all costs!
I can't hold her… (explosion)

DX_M11_0480_PROTO3
PROTO3
(Panicked)
Not enough energy - controls keep locking up!

DX_M11_0460_PROTO2

(Frustrated)
Damn! Energy management just went off-line...!

DX_M11_0470_PROTO1
PROTO1
(Frustrated)
She won't come around - !

When five of the prototypes are destroyed, a formation of four LSF light fighters spawns 2500 m away and attacks.

The prototypes are destroyed. Juni moves close to the Jump Gate and stops.

OBJECTIVE: Protect convoy and Juni

DX_M11_0510_KING
KING
All prototypes destroyed!

DX_M11_0520_JUNI
JUNI
Nice job, everyone. Watch my back while I run Orillion's passcodes on the gate.

DX_M11_0530_KING
KING
Hurry – we’re barely holding on here.

Juni’s only human.

DX_M11_0540_JUNI
JUNI
(stressed; firmly)
I know!

Fifty seconds of combat later:

DX_M11_0550_JUNI
JUNI
Got it! The gate’s unlocked. Trent, King, go ahead. My people will follow you in.

OBJECTIVE: Take Jump Gate to Alaska

King docks with the Jump Gate.

After he jumps, a timer starts. IF the player delays:

DX_M11_0552_JUNI
JUNI
What’s the holdup, Trent? We have GOT to get out of here!

After he jumps, a timer starts. IF the player delays even more:

DX_M11_0554_JUNI
JUNI
This is ridiculous. You are obviously not ready for this mission, and the stakes are too high.

The convoy arrives in Alaska, a dim system filled with murky green mist. As promised, an enormous shipyard complex sits sunwards of the Jump Gate. Several Liberty fighters and battleships move around in the murk, including the Vengeance, which lies directly ahead. Also ahead is the path to the prison station, which is marked with small light buoys.

DX_M11_1120_JUNI
JUNI
I've sealed the Jump Gate behind us.

OBJECTIVE: Follow Walker to prison station

DX_M11_1130_WALKER
WALKER
Roger. Moving out!
(A beat)
Don't fire on anything.

They move forward, but are soon hailed by the Vengeance. These comms are broken into individual sentences so if the player opens fire the sequence can quickly fork.

DX_M11_1190_LN_BSHIP
LN_BSHIP
LSF convoy, this is the Navy battleship Vengeance.

DX_M11_1200_LN_BSHIP
LN_BSHIP
This is a restricted area.

DX_M11_1210_LN_BSHIP
LN_BSHIP
Approach this vessel for inspection.

DX_M11_1220_WALKER
WALKER
Roger, Vengeance.

DX_M11_1230_WALKER
WALKER
This is the LSF cruiser Solitude.

DX_M11_1240_WALKER
WALKER
We are transporting dissidents to the prison station.

DX_M11_1250_LN_BSHIP
LN_BSHIP
Understood, Solitude.

DX_M11_1310_LN_BSHIP
LN_BSHIP
Your credentials are confirmed.

The convoy starts to move forwards.

DX_M11_1320_LN_BSHIP
LN_BSHIP
Proceed.

The ruse is quickly shattered as an ace-level Liberty light fighter arrives with news.

DX_M11_1330_SPOILER
SPOILER
We have a four seventy, Vengeance! Those are Order vessels! The clearance is a fake!

DX_M11_1340_LN_BSHIP
LN_BSHIP
Alert! Intruders – 
(A static burst drowns out the transmission and it fades out)

The battleship opens fire and quickly stops.

DX_M11_1370_KING
KING
What happened? They just went dead!

DX_M11_1380_JUNI
JUNI
I'm exploiting a logic flaw Orillion found in their security routines when he stole the Osiris. It should temporarily cripple their weapons and communications. We have to hurry.

IF the player opens fire prematurely:

DX_M11_1350_KING
KING
Are you trying to kill us, Trent?

DX_M11_1360_WALKER
WALKER
We're in for it. Let's go!

As in the regular action, the Vengeance calls an alert and is quickly squelched.

The convoy fires up its cruise engines and speeds toward the prison.

DX_M11_1400_WALKER
WALKER
We should be at the prison shortly.

DX_M11_0600_KING
KING
Walker, you know this is a dead-end system. We have to take the same way back out.

DX_M11_0605_WALKER
WALKER
I don't have an easy answer, King. It doesn't matter until we get Jacobi.

The convoy drops out of cruise as the Borg cube of the prison station appears from the mist.

DX_M11_0640_WALKER
WALKER
Something’s wrong. The prison station should be hailing us by now.

DX_M11_0650_KING
KING
I don’t like this. The docking ports are live, but there’s no other activity. It’s almost as if all the guards are asleep.

DX_M11_0660_JUNI
JUNI
(Taking the lead)
Or dead.
(A beat)
We don’t have any choice. Maybe we just got lucky.
(A beat)
Ready your sidearms. I’ll dock first. Trent, you’re next. Then King.

Juni docks.

OBJECTIVE: Dock with prison station

If the player delays:

DX_M11_0170_KING
KING
We’re waiting for you, Trent. Time is short.

The player continues to delay:

DX_M11_0175_KING
KING
That’s it, Trent. You’re obviously not ready for this mission.

The player docks with the Prison Station.

DX_M11_0620Z_JUNI
JUNI
Walker, we're jamming long-range transmissions but our cover won’t last long. I recommend playing the surprise card now and destroying the prison's security systems as soon as it's in range.

DX_M11_0630Z_WALKER
WALKER
You're right - if they get suspicious they'll lock the whole station down and we will be unable to force our way in. It will take a perfect shot. Lambda, do you have any torpedoes?

DX_M11_1410Z_LAMBDA1
LAMBDA1
Affirmative, commander.

DX_M11_0640Z_WALKER
WALKER
Excellent. We're counting on you.

The convoy drops out of cruise as the Borg cube of the prison station appears from the mist. Lambda moves forward and opens fire. An explosion blossoms on the prison.

DX_M11_0650Z_KING
KING
Direct hit!

After a few seconds:

DX_M11_0660Z_WALKER
WALKER
Strange. No reaction from the prison… it’s still unlocked and friendly. Docking ports are active. It’s almost as if all the guards are asleep.

DX_M11_0662Z_JUNI
JUNI
Or dead.

Juni moves closer to the station. But after a few seconds:

DX_M11_0670Z_KING
KING
Bad news on the secure channel. They have two officers on patrol who can lock down the station remotely. We’re jamming long-range transmissions, but if they get close to the prison for any length of time…
(Trails off)

DX_M11_0680Z_WALKER
WALKER
All units - destroy any LSF craft on sight!

A few more seconds and a Liberty light fighter appears on radar, headed for the station.

OBJECTIVE: Destroy patrol ship

DX_M11_0690Z_KING
KING
LSF fighter on radar.

IF the LSFer gets within close range of the station, a negative sound effect plays. The first time this happens, Juni comms:

DX_M11_0700Z_JUNI
JUNI
He's started the lockdown!

IF the LSFer then flies out of range, a positive sound effect plays. The first time this happens:

DX_M11_0770Z_KING
KING
We're ok… for now! Stop him!

IF the LSFer stays within range of the station for 25 seconds:

DX_M11_1530Z_JUNI
JUNI
He's almost got it! We HAVE to stop him!

IF the LSFer stays within range for another 25 seconds:

DX_M11_1540Z_KING
KING
There's no more time! Kill that guy!

IF the LSFer stays within range of the station successfully past all the warnings: FAIL

DX_M11_0750Z_JUNI
JUNI
Uh oh.

The first LSFer dies.

DX_M11_0780Z_WALKER
WALKER
You got him!

OBJECTIVE: Protect convoy and Juni

But is soon followed by another:

OBJECTIVE: Destroy patrol ship

DX_M11_0710Z_KING
KING
Another LSF fighter inbound.

The second LSFer’s one-time warning:

DX_M11_0740Z_WALKER
WALKER
This guy is getting too close!

The second LSFer’s one-time abatement-of-threat message:

DX_M11_0760Z_KING
KING
Ok, he's out of range…

IF the second LSFer stays within range of the station for 25 seconds:

DX_M11_1760Z_JUNI
JUNI
He’s on the final protocol!

IF the second LSFer stays within range for another 25 seconds:

DX_M11_1770Z_KING
KING
We’re almost out of time!

The second LSFer is killed:

DX_M11_0790Z_KING
KING
Scratch bandit number two!

DX_M11_0792Z_JUNI

Ready your sidearms. I’ll dock first. Trent, you’re next. Then King.

SCENE:	S069X: INT. ALASKA PRISON STATION – LANDING DECK

The ships land. Juni, Trent, Walker and several others take to the deck with their weapons drawn, expecting resistance - but finding none. There is absolutely NO ONE on the deck, it’s deserted and dank - lights down to an eerie half-power. As the soldiers scan the deck, Walker finds a crate of GRAVATIC MINES. He examines them and finally breaks the silence.

DX_S069X_0101_WALKER
WALKER
I do not like the look of this.

DX_S069X_0201_TRENT
TRENT
Where is everyone?

DX_S069X_0301_JUNI
JUNI
I don’t know. Looks like a trap.

SCENE:	S069XB: INT. ALASKA PRISON STATION – CELL

In the dark, damp cell a figure is strapped to a vertical metal table. Her head turns slightly and she groans softly. She's been drugged and her shoulder has been wounded. This is PRESIDENT JACOBI, thirty-seven, brilliant and beautiful despite the fact that she's obviously not at her best. The sound of dripping water from the grate above stirs her. She opens her eyes slowly, only to find that her hands and feet are bound to a large, rotating interrogation ring. She struggles but a shooting pain in her bandaged shoulder stops her. She yelps in pain. She looks down at it - realizing that she’s been wounded. At that moment, the large metal door across from her opens and several shadowy people come in, backlit from the hall. Two armed ND Liberty Military Officers and SECRETARY REED, late forties, gruff, enter. Reed, noticing his former commander is awake, speaks from the shadows with the slightest hint of regret in his voice. He’s a man who’s been swept up in the current of betrayal.

DX_S069X_0601_REED
REED
Madame President, I’m glad to see you’re awake.

The Officers stay behind as Reed steps into the pool of light near the President. Water continues to drip in the background. Her vision is blurry, but she makes him out.

DX_S069X_0701_JACOBI
JACOBI
(Slowly)
Reed. What’s the meaning of this? Ah!

She lurches forward causing her wound to spasm again.

DX_S069X_0801_REED
REED
I’m sorry about your shoulder. We tried to dress it as well as we could.

DX_S069X_0802_REED
REED
He requested that you be taken unharmed.

DX_S069X_0803_REED
REED
Well, that was not possible.

DX_S069X_0901_JACOBI
JACOBI
Who? Reed, you traitorous snake, who requested?

Reed looks down. He half-turns and motions to the ND Offices. One of them opens the door. The light comes in again and a figure steps through. The officers bow their heads and the figure of CHANCELLOR FLORIAN GUSTAV NIEMANN, fifties, a study in Aristocratic finery and the leader of Rheinland, steps into the light. Reed backs away - head low, his eyes darting between his new master and his old.

DX_S069X_1001_JACOBI
JACOBI
The Chancellor…

The Chancellor smiles.

DX_S069X_1101_NIEMANN
NIEMANN
I’m glad to see these fools didn’t damage you too badly, my dear.

He places a “gentile” hand on Reed who bows his head like a dog. The President seethes.

DX_S069X_1201_NIEMANN
NIEMANN
But time is short.

DX_S069X_1202_NIEMANN
NIEMANN
I wanted these few minutes to plant a seed, as it were.

Niemann smiles at his own humor, leaning in, but this makes the President struggle even more. More pain! Finally, in frustration, she spits in his face. Niemann wipes it off and smiles up at her. Reed looks as if he might protest, but only gets out a couple of sounds until he is stopped cold by Niemann’s icy glance. Wordlessly, he nods for him to go. Obediently, Reed bows his head and looks at the President one last time as he makes for the door.
Niemann extends his brocaded arm without looking back and motions to his men. One of them bows and an unseen switch is thrown. The interrogation ring grinds to life all around the President as it moves forward into the room. Niemann moves away, allowing the ring to move past him. He takes up a position on the opposite side of the room. The President glances around, not knowing what will happen next. It then unexpectedly rotates on its X axis, turning her head over heels. Fear and pain take over.

HALLWAY: Trent and the others move quickly, but stealthily though the hallway, looking for the President’s cell. They stop when the see the figure of Reed exit through the door and walk down the Hall. Hangdog Reed doesn’t know what hit him when he suddenly comes face to face with Juni’s boot. It hits him hard and he hits the ground. Before he knows it, he is surrounded. He’s picked up and slammed against the bulkhead. He opens his mouth to speak, but before he can Juni’s hand weapon is shoved into it. He struggles, but dares not make a sound.

DX_S069X_0401_TRENT
TRENT
(To Reed – dryly)
Any idea where they’re keeping the President?

Reed looks to his right and Reed nods slowly. Juni narrows her eyes.

DX_S069X_0501_JUNI
JUNI
Let’s find out, shall we? Keep watch!

BACK INSIDE: Still upside down, the President and the ring begin to move towards Niemann. Jacobi’s welling anger overpowers her fear.

DX_S069X_1301_JACOBI
JACOBI
I won’t rest until I see you pay for this!

The ring continues to move right up to him as he speaks casually.

DX_S069X_1401_NIEMANN
NIEMANN
I understand your anger, Madame President. I was misdirected at first, too.

DX_S069X_1402_NIEMANN
NIEMANN
But then I had my mind opened to … other possibilities.

DX_S069X_1403_NIEMANN
NIEMANN
As you will.

DX_S069X_1404_JACOBI
JACOBI
(Fearful)
What?!

They are now face-to-face - hers upside down to his. His facial expression changes from calm and kindly to sinister as he reaches out and suddenly places both hands on each side of her head. His eyes roll back and he opens his mouth. It opens, wider, wider and wider … then a LONG PROBOSCIS OF SOMETHING HORRIBLE BEGINS TO WRIGGLE OUT.
CLOSE ON: Her eyes. She screams. The two ND Officers smile reverently. As he forces her mouth open and leans in to her. The thing is struggling to get from his body to hers. The door to the hallway suddenly opens again and Reed stands in the doorway. The ND Officers look up then relax. Then Trent suddenly appears behind Reed and shoves him in the rest of the way with his gun. A BLINDING FIREFIGHT: The Officers raise their weapons and fire past Reed and hit a Redshirt. Trent, Juni and Walker return their fire as the ND’s fire again. Reed is the one who gets it worst, hit on all sides. When it’s done the ND Officers are dead and Reed slips to the floor in a bloody mess. They look up to see the horrifying sight of the Chancellor struggling with the President. All of this action has only redoubled Niemann’s efforts. The worm-like probe is getting closer.

DX_S069X_1501_TRENT
TRENT
Is that the Chancellor?

He hesitates. The Chancellor turns - the big slug-like thing still sticking out of his mouth.

DX_S069X_1601_JUNI
JUNI
Just shoot!

They open fire - BLOWING THE CHANCELLOR UP AGAINST THE WALL with tremendous force blasts, until he slumps to the floor. Juni runs to the President and works to release her as Trent checks the Chancellor's body with his boot.

DX_S069X_16A01_JUNI
JUNI
Madame President, are you alright?

The President is relieved – having being rescued from a terrible fate.

DX_S069X_16B01_JACOBI
JACOBI
(Relieved, trembly)
Thank you!

DX_S069X_1701_JACOBI
JACOBI
(To Trent – pissed as hell)
What the hell did you want an engraved invitation?

DX_S069X_17A01_TRENT
TRENT
(Apologetic – then defensive)
Look, I didn’t…

DX_S069X_17B01_JUNI
JUNI
(Strident and accusatory – cutting Trent off)
You were just going to let that …that … THING attack the President?

DX_S069X_1801_TRENT
TRENT
I’m sorry, I haven’t gotten used to killing political figures on sight yet.

DX_S069X_1901_JUNI
JUNI
Trent, did he look like a human being to you?

DX_S069X_2001_TRENT
TRENT
I’m telling you, I…

As he turns around, THE WORM-LIKE CREATURE, now free of his shell, scurries over the dead Chancellor and straight for Trent.

DX_S069X_2101_JUNI
JUNI (O.S.)
Watch out!

DX_S069X_21A01_TRENT
TRENT
Wha…?!

Before he can react though - Trent is narrowly missed by HUGE plasma fire. The "thing" SCREAMS and is engulfed. It falls to the floor, burning, its twitching parts on fire. SOUND of snapping and popping. Trent, a little singed but alright, looks back at Juni - but it wasn't her. She looks over, as does Trent - at the President, now holding a huge smoking weapon from one of the Guards. She is out of breath from the fire fight and adrenaline but stands defiantly. Anger burns in her eyes.

DX_S069X_2201_JACOBI
JACOBI
(Slowly with venom)
Burn, you son of a bitch!

SPACE: The player launches to space to find the convoy waiting. They blaze out of the Prison Platform which has now come alive with firepower and fighters.

Here comes the hard part. We're not going to surprise them this time.

After a few seconds of flight:

DX_M11_0804_JUNI
JUNI
(Surprised – somewhat fearful)
What is that?!

A swarm of Nomad ships appears directly in front of them and starts to come screaming toward them.

DX_M11_0805_KING
KING
(Near panic)
Nomad ships! We’ve got to get to the Jump Gate!

DX_M11_0806_JUNI
JUNI
(Determined
Do not engage the Nomads.

They clear the nebula and break into the exclusion zone around the Jump Gate.

DX_M11_0807_WALKER
WALKER
(Determined)
The Jump Gate is near. Stay on course! We‘ll make it!

When they emerge from the nebula, they see with disappointment that the Liberty Navy has blocked the Jump Gate back to New York. Two battleships are blocking the entrance supported by six Rheinland Heavy Fighters in strategic positions.

DX_M11_0808_JUNI
JUNI
(Panicking)
They blocked the Jump Gate. We’re trapped!

DX_M11_0809_PHOENIX

The six Heavy Fighters make a torpedo run and hit the cruisers, crippling the Phoenix (second Liberty Cruiser in Walker’s group) and heavily damaging Walker’s ship.

DX_M11_0813_KING
KING
(Determined)
I’m going in!

They fight for about 30 seconds, but the fight is going badly, the battleships have not moved and things are going desperately.  The entire time we here comms from the Cruiser Phoenix about systems failing, life support going offline, and all kinds of typical battle damage.  The Phoenix finally gives way, exploding in angry fury.

IF Phoenix is at 25% health

Walker, what are you talking about?

DX_M11_0821_WALKER

Long shot: Walker’s cruiser flies toward the two battleships and the Jump Gate. 

DX_M11_0824_JUNI
JUNI
(Panicking)
There has to be another way!

The battleships start opening fire. Walkers ship is taking damage (invulnerable once he hit 10% health  and his ship is on fire).

DX_M11_0825_WALKER
WALKER
(Calm)
No, there isn’t. Now get out of here or you’ll be killed too,

Goodbye, Jun’ko. Win this one for me!

Walker’s cruiser slams into one of the battleships and explodes using Brian’s special wide-area Liberty cruiser fuse. Both battleships and two of the heavy fighters are caught in the explosion.

KING
(Tense, but calm)
Juni, he cleared a path for us. This is our chance! The Jump Gate is clear!

DX_M11_0834_JUNI
JUNI
(Slowly coming to her senses)
Alright! Everybody, head for the Jump Gate! We have to make a run for it.

OBJECTIVE: TAKE JUMP GATE TO NEW YORK SYSTEM

After 10 seconds:

DX_M11_0834B_KING
KING
(Tense)
More Nomads are closing. We have to get out of here!

IF the player dallies:
DX_M11_1510B_KING
KING
Trent, what are you doing? We can't wait for you!

Fail:

DX_M11_1550_KING
KING
That’s it. The Nomads are about to kill Jacobi. We’re out of time.

When the ships arrive back at in the center of Zone 21, they find themselves surrounded by three Liberty cruisers and a Liberty battleship, all lined up broadside to the passage mouth.

DX_M11_0990_JUNI
JUNI
Dammit!

DX_M11_0990B_JUNI
JUNI
Nomad ships! Looks like they want Jacobi back … or dead. Trent, take the lead, we have to get out of here.

DX_M11_1030_VENGEANCE
VENGEANCE
(Stern and forceful)
This is the Omaha. Give yourselves up. You are outnumbered and outgunned. Return the President and we will spare your life.

DX_M11_1040_KING
KING
Right!

DX_M11_1050_JUNI
JUNI
What are we gonna do?

DX_M11_1050B_JUNI
JUNI
Doesn’t matter! We can’t take another beating. Everyone, let’s go.

Several moments of frantic, hopeless combat pass by.

SCENE:	SPACE RTC 22: START: OSIRIS TAKES ON BATTLEGROUP

The Osiris uncloaks behind the Liberty capital ships. The remnants of the mission group head toward its docking bays, except for the Phoenix, which (if alive) takes this moment to cruise off for open space. Meanwhile, the Osiris’ guns concentrate on cruiser after cruiser, destroying everything except the Liberty battleship.

DX_M11_1080_TRENT
TRENT
The Osiris!

The Osiris fires several broadsides into the Liberty Navy ships. The Battleship immediately explodes in a bright flash.

DX_M11_1100_ORILLION
ORILLION
Jun’ko, Mr. Trent … get aboard, quickly.

DX_M11_1101_JUNI
JUNI
Trent, you first. Hurry!

IF Trent doesn’t dock:

DX_M11_1102_JUNI
JUNI
Hurry, Trent! We’ve got to get the President out of here! Land on the Osiris.

IF Trent still doesn’t dock.

DX_M11_1103_JUNI
JUNI
That’s it. We’re leaving you behind!

Trent docks with the Osiris.

SCENE:	SPACE RTC 22: END: OSIRIS TAKES ON BATTLEGROUP

SCENE:	S070XA: INT. ORDER BATTLESHIP OSIRIS – LANDING DECK

They begin to get out of their ships as Orillion and a few others come to the deck.  They walk up to Juni.

DX_S070X_0101_ORILLION
ORILLION
Report, Colonel Zane!

DX_S070X_0201_JUNI
JUNI
Sir, we have Jacobi. The Chancellor is dead … so are several of his Liberty hosts.

DX_S070X_0202_JUNI
JUNI
We have some weapons and raided their tactical files.

She holds up a data chip.

DX_S070X_0301_ORILLION
ORILLION
(To an Aide)
Have it analyzed.

The Aide takes the chip and leaves. Juni is uneasy … she left something out.

DX_S070X_0401_JUNI
JUNI
(Moving to the Artifact)
We also lost some, Sir.

DX_S070X_0402_JUNI
JUNI
Walker was one of them…

DX_S070X_0501_ORILLION
ORILLION
(Nods solemnly)
Understood… I take it then the President is unharmed?

DX_S070X_0601_JACOBI
PRESIDENT JACOBI (O.S.)
Not exactly unharmed!

She sorely limps in with Trent and King.

DX_S070X_0701_JACOBI
PRESIDENT JACOBI
But still me if that’s what you mean.

Orillion shoots a glance at Juni, who nods her affirmation.

DX_S070X_0801_JACOBI
PRESIDENT JACOBI
Judging how everyone is acting, I assume you are the go to man around here?!

DX_S070X_0901_JUNI
JUNI
President Jacobi, meet Casper Orillion!

DX_S070X_1001_JACOBI
PRESIDENT JACOBI
(Slowly … some surprise)
So! You’re Orillion?!

He nods. She walks up to him, studying his face. She’s heard a lot about him … all bad. His men did save her though. Finally!

DX_S070X_1101_JACOBI
PRESIDENT JACOBI
(Genuinely)
Thank you!

She extends her hand. He accepts it.

DX_S070X_1201_ORILLION
ORILLION
Madame President, these are the people you should be thanking.

Another AIDE steps in.

DX_S070X_1301_ASSIST_03
AIDE
Sir, we’ve cleared the Badlands. Your orders?

DX_S070X_1401_ORILLION
ORILLION
Set course for Toledo. Tell Quintaine we may have more information for him.

Orillion looks at the President and all.

DX_S070X_1501_ORILLION
ORILLION
Oh and … tell him we’ve got an official guest for him to meet.

Orillion smiles…

DX_S070X_1601_JUNI
JUNI
Come on, Colonel Trent! Have a drink with a fellow officer.

She pulls him away to -

SCENE:	S070XB: INT. ORDER BATTLESHIP OSIRIS – BAR

Juni pours two drinks and settles down in a corner table with Trent. She hands him the glass.

DX_S070X_1701_JUNI
JUNI
Do you remember, Trent, when I said “people are changed by their world, rarely vice versa”?

DX_S070X_1801_TRENT
TRENT
No.

DX_S070X_1901_JUNI
JUNI
Well, I did. You know what? I was wrong!

DX_S070X_1902_JUNI
JUNI
Truly for some people, they can change the world. We’re doing it, right now!

DX_S070X_1903_JUNI
JUNI
Thank you for showing me that.

She drinks. He nods…

DX_S070X_2001_TRENT
TRENT
You’re welcome!

DX_S070X_2101_ASSIST_03
AIDE (O.S.)
(Filter over ships PA)
Attention! Colonel Trent, please report to Orillion on the Landing Deck at once.

It ruins the mood.

DX_S070X_2201_JUNI
JUNI
A briefing?

DX_S070X_2301_TRENT
TRENT
I don’t know. We’ll get back to this later … I promise!

He leaves her there and heads out of the door.

SCENE:	S070XC: INT. ODER BATTLESHIP OSIRIS – LANDING DECK

Trent finds the President and Orillion speaking on the Landing Deck. The President looks almost sad.

DX_S070X_2401_TRENT
TRENT
(To Orillion)
Excuse me. You wanted to see me, Sir?

DX_S070X_2501_JACOBI
PRESIDENT JACOBI
Actually, I did, Colonel. I never properly thanked you for what you did back there on the prison ship.

DX_S070X_2601_TRENT
TRENT
(With a nod)
You’re welcome, Madame President.

DX_S070X_2701_JACOBI
PRESIDENT JACOBI
Mr. Orillion was just filling me in on the Nomad’s progress in the colonies.

DX_S070X_2801_ORILLION
ORILLION
(To Trent)
The information your team brought back has shown a clear spread of the contamination. All of the colonies have now been affected.

DX_S070X_2802_ORILLION
ORILLION
If not the leaders, then key military units in the field … they’re getting stronger.

DX_S070X_2803_ORILLION
ORILLION
Communication is breaking down. Soon this will develop into all our genocide.

DX_S070X_2804_ORILLION
ORILLION
With the Nomads coming in to easily wipe out what’s left. We need…

Orillion hesitates.

DX_S070X_2901_TRENT
TRENT
What?

DX_S070X_3001_JACOBI
PRESIDENT JACOBI
What no man can provide us, Mr. Trent. We need a miracle!

They both walk out, leaving Trent alone on the deck. The Launch button is still not available. When Trent selects the Bar button, the following scene plays.

MISSION:	BECOMES AVAILABLE

This mission becomes immediately available after the end of mission 11. When the player selects the Bar button, the following scene plays. Note: all weapons and the Order ship on the Osiris should be practically free of charge. This way, the player can acquire everything that is available for the final missions.

SCENE:	S071A: OFFER – INT. ORDER BATTLESHIP OSIRIS – BAR

Trent walks up to King who is relaxing in the lounge.

DX_S071A_0101_KING
KING
So, here we are my friend, in the thick of it.

DX_S071A_0102_KING
KING
I remember when you were fresh off the boat in Liberty… Seems like ages ago, doesn’t it?

DX_S071A_0201_TRENT
TRENT
Ha, it’s not the time … it’s the sides that keep changing.

Juni rushes in, breaking his moment.

DX_S071A_0301_JUNI
JUNI
C’mon you two. We have work to do!

DX_S071A_0401_KING
KING
(Rather distress by the thought)
What? Work?!

DX_S071A_0501_JUNI
JUNI
Come on, Trent. It’s just the kind of mission you love. What do you say?

After the scene has finished, the MISSION OFFER PANEL appears with more detailed information concerning the mission and offering choices to ACCEPT or DECLINE the mission.

The Offer Panel comes up:

EXTRACT NOMAD POWER CELL

Objective:	Extract a Nomad power cell from an unknown Alien structure in this system. You have to use your tractor beam to get the needed power cell.
Difficulty:	The attack on the Nomad Lair is a suicide mission.
Reward:		This is not about money it’s about survival.

SCENE:	S071B: ACCEPT – INT. ORDER BATTLESHIP OSIRIS – BAR

DX_S071B_0101_TRENT
TRENT
Sure. As long as I’m not shot at, knocked out, held at gunpoint, electrocuted…

DX_S071B_0102_TRENT
TRENT
…skewered alive by giant alien shape shifters, have to dive out windows or fight of spindly Nomad incubi …

DX_S071B_0103_TRENT
TRENT
Everything should be fine.

DX_S071B_0201_JUNI
JUNI
It’s something for Quintaine and Sinclair. They need something … BIG!

DX_S071B_0301_TRENT
TRENT
How big?

DX_S071B_0401_JUNI
JUNI
They say that in order to activate the Artifact, they need a Nomad power cell.

DX_S071B_0501_KING
KING
(Protesting)
Oh, you’ve got to be …

DX_S071B_0601_JUNI
JUNI
(Cutting him off)
Orillion has located a Nomad power source nearby. Once we have it, we’ll head straight for the Order base in Toledo.

King glances at Trent who is already on board. Trent nods his approval. King looks back at Juni, who is not backing down. He finally resigns.

DX_S071B_0701_JUNI
JUNI
(Satisfied … to the point)
Let’s go!

They all exit the frame.

SCENE:	S071C: DECLINE – INT. ORDER BATTLESHIP OSIRIS – BAR

DX_S071C_0101_TRENT
TRENT
I’m not sure about this one.

DX_S071C_0201_JUNI
JUNI
Trent, unless we do this, we’re dead in the water, you understand? King and I can’t do this without you.

DX_S071C_0301_TRENT
TRENT
I won’t be long.

DX_S071C_0401_JUNI
JUNI
(Slightly annoyed)
We’ll be here.

He exits frame.

SCENE:	S071D: REOFFER – INT. ORDER BATTLESHIP OSIRIS – BAR

King and Juni are in the Osiris lounge as Trent enters.

DX_S071D_0101_JUNI
JUNI
Trent, we’ve still got a job to do. Are you with me?

After the scene has finished, the MISSION OFFER PANEL appears with more detailed information concerning the mission and offering choices to ACCEPT or DECLINE the mission.

OBJECTIVE: LAUNCH TO SPACE

The Osiris is positioned about 10km north of the Nomad Lair. Once the player launches, Juni and King await him in space and Orillion sends a comm.:

DX_M12_0100_ORILLION
ORILLION
(Official)
Here’s our intel. Long range scanners have picked up a Nomad power source at the center of a giant structure. It’s surrounded by a plasma cloud that prevents deeper scans.

DX_M12_0110_JUNI
JUNI
Are you detecting any Nomad in the area?

DX_M12_0120_ORILLION
ORILLION
(Official)
Negative. The structure appears to be abandoned, but keep your eyes open. I’m uploading the coordinates.

DX_M12_0130_ORILLION
ORILLION
(Official)
Listen, the Jump Hole we used to get here is de-stabilizing. We have to take the Osiris through now. It will be stable enough for small ships … but not for long. You have to get the power source quickly and get out of here.

SCENE:	SPACE RTC 17: START: OSIRIS CLOAKS OUT

The Osiris cloaks out and leaves Trent, Juni and King alone in the Lair system.

SCENE:	SPACE RTC 1: END: OSIRIS CLOAKS OUT

DX_M12_0140_KING
KING
Understood! All right, people! Let’s do it.

DX_M12_0145_ORILLION
ORILLION
According to our readings, the Jump Hole will close in 10 minutes.

DX_M12_0146_ORILLION
ORILLION
I have activated a count-down in your Neural Net. It is imperative that you make it back before the Jump Hole closes.

OBJECTIVE: GO TO WAYPOINT

King flies straight down the z-plane. A waypoint is visible directly beneath the Osiris.

DX_M12_0150_JUNI
JUNI
Trent, you take point. King and I will take flanking positions.

After a few seconds of flight …

DX_M12_0160_KING
KING
We’re directly above the structure. No visuals yet.

The three ships keep fly through the asteroid field … they finally clear the asteroids and the Lair comes into view.

DX_M12_0170_KING
KING
Look at the size of that thing….

Once they reach a 3k perimeter, the cruise engines cut out due to a disruption zone.

DX_M12_0180_KING
KING
What the hell was that?!

DX_M12_0190_JUNI
JUNI
Scanners picking up massive readings…

Suddenly contacts light up on the screen and the contact list fills with hostiles. The Nomads uncloak and head straight at the three ships.

DX_M12_0200_KING
KING
(Panicking)
It’s a trap! I’m reading dozens of ships!

DX_M12_0210_JUNI
JUNI
(Surprised and serious)
The power cell seems to be inside a central chamber. Looks like the only way in is through the vents on the top of the structure. King and I will draw their fire, Trent! Head for the core and get that power cell.

OBJECTIVE: FLY INTO THE ALIEN STRUCTURE

King and Juni break left and right respectively and fly directly toward the Nomads. Trent must now head straight to the core. He will be attacked along the way. Trent’s only goal is to go get the core.

By now the player should be in HEAVY combat. The following comms will play.

IF King is 30% damaged

DX_M12_0220_KING
KING
(Stressed)
Trent! Hurry up! We can’t hold out forever!

IF King is 60% damaged

DX_M12_0230_KING
KING
(Alerted over battle noise)
Taking heavy damage! I don’t know how long I can keep it together!

IF King is 90% damaged

DX_M12_0240_KING
KING
(Panicking over battle noise)
Containment leak, hull buckling!!

IF Juni is 30% damaged

DX_M12_0250_JUNI
JUNI 
(Stressed)
We’re holding them back Trent! Get into the Lair!

IF Juni is 60% damaged

DX_M12_0260_JUNI
JUNI
(Exasperated over battle noise)
They just keep coming! You’ve got to hurry Trent!

IF Juni is 90% damaged

DX_M12_0270_JUNI
JUNI 
(Panicking over battle noise)
Losing shield containment! Structural integrity degrading!

Once Trent reaches a tight range trigger near the entrance to the Lair (near the waypoint)

DX_M12_0280_JUNI
JUNI 
Reading shows that the interior is filled with radiation. You’ll only be able to withstand that for a minute or two … you have to be quick!

OBJECTIVE: EXTRACT NOMAD POWER CELL

Once Trent is inside the Lair:

DX_M12_0290_JUNI
JUNI
(Over heavy static)
Trent, we’re running out of time! The Jump Hole is starting to collapse and… [static]

DX_M12_0300_KING
KING
(Over heavy static to fade out)
Juni! On your six! Bank hard right!

DX_M12_0310_JUNI
JUNI
(Almost not audible)
I can’t shake him! [static]

Nothing is left but silence. The radiation is blocking the comms. The radiation is also damaging the ship. Trent has to grab the core and leave.

OBJECTIVE: USE TRACTOR BEAM TO RETRIEVE POWER CELL

Once Trent has the Nomad power cell, he has to leave: A new waypoint appears to indicate the exit.

OBJECTIVE: EXIT THE LAIR

Once Trent emerges on the outside of the Lair again, he finds a scene of total chaos. Juni immediately sends him a comm.:

DX_M12_0320_JUNI
JUNI
(In a heavy panic)
Trent! Thank god you’re all right!

DX_M12_0330_KING
KING
(In a heavy panic)
We’re surrounded! The more we shoot down, the more they keep coming.

DX_M12_0340_JUNI
JUNI
(Serious but definitely anxious) 
Trent, the Jump Hole is closing fast! King and I are on our way out. Go!

OBJECTIVE: GO TO JUMP HOLE

DX_M12_0350_KING
KING
(Ready to leave)
No time for fancy formations on this one. Run for it Trent! 

The area is swarming with Nomads almost immediately upon exit. Trent must get to the jump hole before time runs out. On the way to the hole, he will encounter several wings of interceptors. His only goal is to get out of here. Trent and Juni kick the engines a few seconds after you exit.

On the way to the hole:

DX_M12_0360_JUNI
JUNI
(Urgent)
Osiris! This is Juni! We got the power cell and are heading home! Do you copy?

DX_M12_0370_ORILLION
ORILLION
(Over heavy static, almost inaudible)
Jun’ko, your signal is breaking up….

DX_M12_0380_JUNI
JUNI
(In a heavy panic)
Orillion, come in! Do you copy, over!
(Frustrated)
Damn it! Something is jamming our frequencies!

Timed comms on the way to the hole…

IF 4.5 minutes to closure of the Jump Hole

DX_M12_0390_ORILLION
ORILLION
(Alert)
Trent, the Jump Hole is closing fast, you have to hurry!

IF 2.5 minutes to closure of the Jump Hole

DX_M12_0400_ORILLION
ORILLION
(Alert)
The Jump Hole is almost closed! Trent, get out of there!

IF 0.5 minutes to closure of the Jump Hole

DX_M12_0410_ORILLION
ORILLION
(Alert)
Trent, you only have a few seconds left to get out!

Once Trent arrives in Omicron Minor:

A Nav marker is placed immediately upon exit on Omicron Minor.

SCENE:	SPACE RTC 17B: START: NOMADS UNCLOAK

When Trent comes out of the Jump Hole, he is greeted by a 5 Nomad Gunboats and 20 Nomad Fighters who uncloak just as they enter the system. This is all in set scene: 

DX_M12_0420_KING
KING
(Sardonic)
Dammit! I don’t think we’re getting out of this one.

DX_M12_0430_JUNI
JUNI
(Alert)
King! Trent! In bound at 12’o’clock high!

Before the Nomads can fire, the camera pans full swing up. A small fighter is coming in at full speed. The ship type has never been scene before. (Yes, I want some kind of Rheinland Super Heavy Fighter with some ridiculously powerful guns JUST for Von Claussen)

DX_M12_0440_VON_CLAUSSEN
VON CLAUSSEN
(Cold blooded – quoting Dante)
For every spirit, there’s a proper place in HELL!!!

The camera follows Von Claussen as he blows completely through one of the Nomad Gunboats.

SCENE:	SPACE RTC 17B: END: NOMADS UNCLOAK

DX_M12_0450_KING
KING
(Surprised)
What?!

DX_M12_0460_JUNI
JUNI
(Relieved and determined)
Von Claussen!

He kills tons of Nomads…

DX_M12_0470_VON_CLAUSSEN
VON CLAUSSEN
(Still cold blooded – continues with Dante)
Here each one learns his judgment and is assigned a place in hell.

OBJECTIVE: DESTROY NOMADS

Once the last Nomad ship has been destroyed:

DX_M12_0480_JUNI
JUNI
(Thankful)
That was close! Thank you, Herr Von Claussen.

DX_M12_0490_VON_CLAUSSEN
VON CLAUSSEN
(Still cold blooded – no more Dante – but satisfied)
Long range radar had picked up increased Nomad activity in this area. I thought you could use some help.
(A beat)
We have to leave before they return. Head to Toledo.

OBJECTIVE: FLY TO OMICRON MINOR

After a few seconds of flight:

DX_M12_0500_VON_CLAUSSEN
VON CLAUSSEN
We have reports that the Kusari fleet has been defeated near New Tokyo.

DX_M12_0510_JUNI
JUNI
No!

DX_M12_0520_VON_CLAUSSEN
VON CLAUSSEN
(Still cold blooded – no more Dante – but satisfied)
The Nomads are now freely roaming throughout the colonies. The have begun their attack on Bretonia … nothing can stop them now.

DX_M12_0530_JUNI
JUNI
Let’s hope the Artifact will.

DX_M12_0540_VON_CLAUSSEN

DX_M12_0670_TRENT
TRENT
What is this place?

DX_M12_0680_VON_CLAUSSEN
VON CLAUSSEN
This, Mr. Trent, is the secret home of the Order. Orillion and his people have built this out of nothing in only a few months.

After a few seconds, they approach the landing platform near the huge cliff wall that is home to the Order’s secret base of operations.

DX_M12_0690_KING
KING
Put your ship down on the landing pad over there.

After a few seconds, they approach the landing platform near the huge cliff wall that is home to the Order’s secret base of operations.

Take it directly to Doctor Quintaine in the Artifact lab.

The two Techs pull the rectangular section past them on a maglev cast. The Camera follows it, shooting down at it shimmering in the passing lights.

SCENE:	S072AB: OFFER – INT. ORDER BASE TOLEDO – ARTIFACT LAB

The shimmering rectangle gives way to a shimmering cursor on a screen. SYMBOLS begin to appear behind the cursor as it moves across the flat panel screen. Camera widens to show a lot of symbols arranged into a complex lexicon.

DX_S072A_1201_JACOBI
JACOBI
Shh!

Sinclair and Quintaine exchange glances. She continues.

DX_S072A_1301_SINCLAIR
SINCLAIR
Well, in a manner of speaking.

DX_S072A_1302_SINCLAIR
SINCLAIR
They are opportunistic parasites, not …

DX_S072A_1303_SINCLAIR
SINCLAIR
… only of Human Beings, but of technology, as well.

DX_S072A_1304_SINCLAIR
SINCLAIR
They’ve adapted what the Daam-K'Vosh had built to suit their own purposes, living off of their power!

Quintaine moves toward the artifact.

DX_S072A_1401_QUINTAINE
QUINTAINE
(Moving to the Artifact)
Which brings us to the Artifact!

DX_S072A_1402_QUINTAINE
QUINTAINE
The Daam-K’Vosh had an amazingly advanced technology that was only partially based in these delicate formations.

DX_S072A_1403_QUINTAINE
QUINTAINE
They used them for power, shields … em … this one is, a, em …

DX_S072A_1404_QUINTAINE
QUINTAINE
… well, we’ll show you. Kendra?

Sinclair and Quintaine exchange glances. She continues. He looks at Sinclair who, off his glance, begins to load a program.

DX_S072A_1501_SINCLAIR
SINCLAIR
(Progressively more excited)
I discovered that if the computer sounded out the phonetic representation of the glyphs in a particular order …

DX_S072A_1502_SINCLAIR
SINCLAIR
… it had a direct affect on the substrate of the Artifact, creating a charge. Now that we have the power cell, which is tied to –

DX_S072A_1601_JACOBI
PRESIDENT JACOBI
Please, Doctor, in deference to those for us who are simple politicians …

She looks up. They are all lost. Sinclair smiles, a little embarrassed. This is her element.

DX_S072A_1701_SINCLAIR
SINCLAIR
(Sheepishly)
Very well!

She presses a blinking box on the screen and the room comes to life - A low sound fills the air like TIBETAN MONKS CHANTING as the panels light up in series - as they watch.

Sinclair makes some adjustments and it goes faster … and faster ... and faster - at a rate that only a computer could replicate. The artifact glows and vibrates.

Finally, the SEQUENCE reaches a fever pitch and the ARTIFACT EXPLODES WITH COLOR AND RADIANCE into a kind of MAP - with vectors traveling off in various holographic directions that would extend well beyond the room.

DX_S072A_1801_ORILLION
ORILLION
I’ll be damned.

DX_S072A_1901_JACOBI
PRESIDENT JACOBI
It’s beautiful!

Trent looks at a dot in front of his vision, blinking softly.

DX_S072A_2001_TRENT
TRENT
What’s that?

DX_S072A_2101_SINCLAIR
SINCLAIR
That would be us. The artifact knows where it is in space at all times. It’s a map!

DX_S072A_2201_JUNI
JUNI
But of what?!

Sinclair looks at Quintaine. She swallows.

DX_S072A_2301_SINCLAIR
SINCLAIR
Well, it’s just a theory, but…

DX_S072A_2401_ORILLION
ORILLION
Spit it out, Doctor!

Quintaine interjects.

DX_S072A_2501_QUINTAINE
QUINTAINE
From what we now know, with an empire as large as the Daam-K’Vosh …

DX_S072A_2502_QUINTAINE
QUINTAINE
… they couldn’t rely on simple Jumpgates like we have today.

DX_S072A_2503_QUINTAINE
QUINTAINE
They had to develop something more sophisticated. A vast array of hypergates …

DX_S072A_2504_QUINTAINE
QUINTAINE
… linking the far corner of their empire via one incredible fast system for travel.

DX_S072A_2505_QUINTAINE
QUINTAINE
This device is not only the map, it’s the trigger. A key to reawakening the system!

They all look dumbfounded. Finally...

DX_S072A_2601_ORILLION
ORILLION
Are you suggesting we turn this thing on?

DX_S072A_2701_QUINTAINE
QUINTAINE
Yes. If we can reactivate the hypergates …

DX_S072A_2702_QUINTAINE
QUINTAINE
… we’ll brake the hold of the Nomads on their power supply and cut them down to a more manageable size.

DX_S072A_2703_QUINTAINE
QUINTAINE
(Pause)
In theory!

DX_S072A_2801_ORILLION
ORILLION
Every key has a lock, Doctor. Where do we find this one?

Quintaine moves through the beams that break as he passes. He walks in front of the President and finds a light bundle. He points.

DX_S072A_2901_QUINTAINE
QUINTAINE
There!

DX_S072A_3001_ORILLION
ORILLION
Mr. Trent?

This catches him off guard.

DX_S072A_3101_TRENT
TRENT
Me?

DX_S072A_3201_ORILLION
ORILLION
Yes, you! I want you and Zane to spearhead this effort. Understood?

After the scene has finished, the MISSION OFFER PANEL appears with more detailed information concerning the mission and offering choices to ACCEPT or DECLINE the mission.

The Offer Panel comes up:

ACTIVATE DAAM-K’VOSH HYPERGATES

Objective:	Fly into the Nomad home system and activate the Hyper Gate system.
Difficulty:	The attack on the Nomad home world is another suicide mission.
Reward:	This is not about money it’s about the survival of mankind. Orillion offers you one of the highly sophisticated Order Heavy Fighters as a reward. The dealers on Toledo will give you whatever you desire – a new ship, weapons, shield.

SCENE:	S072B: ACCEPT – INT. ORDER BASE TOLEDO – ARTIFACT LAB

Trent looks around the room at everyone’s expectant faces.

DX_S072B_0101_TRENT
TRENT
Alright! I’ve come this far, I may as well see it through.

A BLAST is heard suddenly, breaking the atmosphere. Rumble. The Camera shakes. ALARMS! Orillion jumps up and hits a button on his wrist.

DX_S072B_0201_ORILLION
ORILLION
(To his wrist)
What’s going on?

DX_S072B_0301_ASSISTANT3
ASSISTANT 3
(Filter)
Nomads, sir! A whole fleet of them!

DX_S072B_0401_ORILLION
ORILLION
(To his wrist)
Prepare ships for intercept!

DX_S072B_0501_ASSISTANT3
ASSISTANT 3
(Filter)
Aye, sir!

DX_S072B_0601_ORILLION
ORILLION
Dammit, they must have followed us!

He turns to Juni and Trent.

DX_S072B_0701_ORILLION
ORILLION
We have to evacuate. Everybody to their ships! Take only what you need.

DX_S072B_0702_ORILLION
ORILLION
Trent, Juni! We have to buy some time.

Juni looks at Trent and then back.

DX_S072B_0801_JUNI
JUNI
We’re on it!

Orillion turns to the Doctors.

DX_S072B_0901_ORILLION
ORILLION
Now, how do we turn this tinker toy into a weapon?

Trent and Juni now have to start. Need to think about what happens if player never launches – error case that blows up the base? Should we auto-launch – could be bad since the player might have a shitty ship at this state.

SCENE:	S072C: DECLINE – INT. ORDER BASE TOLEDO – ARTIFACT LAB

DX_S072C_0101_TRENT
TRENT
I don’t think I can do this.

He heads for the door.

DX_S072C_0201_JUNI
JUNI
Trent!?!!

DX_S072C_0301_ORILLION
ORILLION
No. Let him go. The man’s earned the right to a little time. He’ll be back.

Status; Trent has not accepted the final mission. He can’t really go anywhere since the space population is already hostile.

SCENE:	S072D: REOFFER – INT. ORDER BASE TOLEDO – ARTIFACT LAB

All of the usual suspects are in the room. The map still pulses in the background. A door is head off screen and Trent steps into frame. The others look up at him. Orillion steps forward.

DX_S072D_0101_TRENT
TRENT
Orillion! I’m ready.

DX_S072D_0201_ORILLION
ORILLION
Trent, I’m happy to see you’ve come back. I take it you’ve reconsidered?

After the scene has finished, the MISSION OFFER PANEL appears with more detailed information concerning the mission and offering choices to ACCEPT or DECLINE the mission.

SCENE:	S073X: INT. ORDER BASE TOLEDO – LANDING DECK

Trent, King, Juni, Von Claussen and others run out of the entrance to the mountain base out to the landing pads. The scene outside is somewhat chaotic: a number of pilots are running to their ships, some ships are taking off, and a loudspeaker voice is giving commands and updates.

DX_S073X_0101_LOUDSPEAKER
LOUDSPEAKER VOICE
Alpha and Gamma wings … cleared for launch.

In the distances, several Order ships can be seen quickly taking off from the surface. Trent and Juni run side-by-side to their ships.

DX_S073X_0201_LOUDSPEAKER
LOUDSPEAKER VOICE
(Explosion sfx)
The Nomads have destroyed the primary generator! All support personnel, move to evacuation points immediately!

The first explosions from the Nomad bombardment go off in the distance. They reach Juni’s fighter first. We see the scene between Juni and Trent from a high camera.

DX_S073X_0301_TRENT
TRENT
Be careful out there!

Juni enters her ship.

DX_S073X_0401_JUNI.WAV
JUNI
You too!

Hand signals by all pilots before they fly off into space. We see Juni, Trent and a number of other Order ships jump start into space.

IN SPACE

Many ships appear from the planet surface. Everything the Order has to muster. The Nomads are very near and furious combat can be seen very near the Docking Ring. The large defense platforms are firing, but the Nomads seem to have the upper hand.

In case S073X can’t be produced, this Orillion line is a backup plan to provide the same information to the player when arriving in space.

DX_M13_0100_ORILLION
ORILLION
(Very heavy static - explosions)
This is Orillion. The base is taking heavy damage from the Nomad attack group - several dozen small Nomad ships. We don’t know where they’re coming from. You have to hold them off as long as you can. Orillion out!

DX_M13_0110_JUNI

(Very tense)
Trent, that’s a personnel transport. We need to help them first. Let’s go.

OBJECTIVE: DEFEND TRANSPORT

The transport is on fire. As they get into 200 meter range, the following comm. plays:

DX_M13_0160_TRANSPORT

IF Nomad capital ship is down to 00% and explodes in a HUGE detonation

DX_M13_0440_JUNI
JUNI

We did it! All wings - take out the remaining fighters!

About 10 seconds after the Nomad capital ship has been destroyed, another one appears with a huge uncloaking special effect…

DX_M13_0450_JUNI
JUNI
(Shocked)
Dam it! Another Nomad capital ship just uncloaked. All units… break off your attacks and engage the capital ship!

A few seconds after this comm., Orillion recalls Juni and Trent back to the planet surface.

DX_M13_0460_ORILLION
ORILLION
Colonel Trent! Colonel Zane! Break away from the battle and return to base immediately.

DX_M13_0470_JUNI
JUNI
(Defiant)
Sir, another Nomad capital ship just uncloaked! We can’t leave…

DX_M13_0480_ORILLION
ORILLION
That’s an order. Our tinker toy weapon is ready …

DX_M13_0490_JUNI
JUNI
(Giving in)
Understood! Returning to base!
(To Trent)
Come on, Trent. Don’t engage any Nomad fighters. We have to get back to Orillion.

Juni is now in guide behavior – in always execute.

OBJECTIVE: FOLLOW JUNI BACK TO BASE

Once Trent and Juni reach a range trigger near the Omicron Minor Docking Ring:

DX_M13_0500_JUNI
JUNI
(Commanding)
You go first, Trent. I’ll meet you on the surface.

When Trent and Juni land on the planet that houses the secret main base of “The Order”, the following RTC sequence automatically plays.

SCENE:	S074XA: EXT. ORDER BASE TOLEDO – LANDING SEQUENCE

Trent’s and Juni’s ships approach the Order base. Fires and smoke are very visible against the snowy surface of the planet. It is obvious that the base took a pounding. As the two ships close in on the landing pad, several transports are visible in the distance leaving the surface with their fighter escorts. More explosions go off as Trent and Juni land their ships. As they approach the landing pad, several wings of Order ships protecting fighters are launching to space. Burning ships can be seen on the surface.

DX_S074X_0001_TRENT
TRENT
(Stunned)
Looks like the base has taken a pounding!

DX_S074X_0002_JUNI
JUNI
The evacuation should be almost complete. We have to land quickly.

Trent and Juni’s ship set down on the surface. Explosions are going off in the vicinity.

SCENE:	S074X: EXT. ORDER BASE TOLEDO – LANDING DECK

Trent’s ship lands - explosions are going off around them. Sinclair, Quintaine and Orillion await him on the deck. Two Techs are pushing a maglev over to Trent's ship and start installing the modified Artifact.

DX_S074X_0101_QUINTAINE
QUINTAINE
(Urgent)
Trent, we’ve made modifications to the Artifact. It should work now.

DX_S074X_0102_QUINTAINE
QUINTAINE
(Urgent)
All you need to do is activate it in the right location. What’s the status out there?

DX_S074X_0201_TRENT.WAV
TRENT
It’s unbelievable! The Nomads are constantly getting reinforcements. We won’t be able to hold them off much longer.

The Techs complete their work and address Orillion.

DX_S074X_0301_ORDERTECH1.WAV
ORDER TECH 1
All set, sir!

DX_S074X_0401_ORILLION.WAV
ORLLION
This it is. Everybody to their ships! Trent, Juni – escort the freighter with Quintaine and Sinclair.

DX_S074X_0402_ORILLION.WAV
ORLLION
Our forces will meet in the Nebula field on the far side of the system. Good luck.

They run to their ships and auto-launch amidst more explosions.

SCENE:	S074XC: EXT. ORDER BASE TOLEDO – LAUNCH SEQUENCE

Ideally, we would have a launch sequence here that shows Juni and Trent flying in formation with an armored transport carrying Sinclair and Quintaine.

DX_S074X_0501_JUNI
JUNI
(Determined)
Quintaine, fly directly to the rallying point in the nebula. Trent and I will provide you cover.

DX_S074X_0601_QUINTAINE
QUINTAINE
Understood! We’re on our way.

Trent and Juni’s ship set down on the surface. Explosions are going off in the vicinity.

IN SPACE:

When Trent emerges in space, Juni and the armored transport carrying Quintaine and Sinclair await him near the Docking Ring. There are still tons of Nomads in the area.

DX_M13_0510_ORILLION
ORILLION
(Commanding)
We‘re picking up another set of signals! Yet another Nomad Capital Ship is approaching Omicron. All combat wings; concentrate your fire on that ship and whatever else they throw at is. It is imperative that we buy our people some time to evacuate! I’m heading to the Osiris.
(To Juni)
Colonel Zane, make sure that Quintaine and Sinclair get safely to the rallying point.

DX_M13_0520_JUNI
JUNI
(Delighted)
Yes, Sir!

The three ships fly toward the edge of the nebula (30-45 seconds).

DX_M13_0530_ORILLION
ORILLION
(Commanding)
To all units … I’ve arrived on the Osiris and we have reached the rallying point. Everybody … fall back!

At a certain trigger point, several Nomad ships are spawned – some are attacking the freighter, some the player.

DX_M13_0540_JUNI
JUNI
(Alerted)
Dammit! Trent, we have to protect the transport at all costs. Quintaine, keep heading toward the Osiris…

DX_M13_0550_QUINTAINE
QUINTAINE
Understood! Just keep those fighters away from us.

After they enter the Nebula and seem clear of enemy fire

DX_M13_0560_JUNI
JUNI
(Delighted)
We made it! The Nomads are falling back.

A wing of Order ships joins the group.

DX_M13_0570_DELTA_LEADER
DELTA LEADER
This is Delta Leader. Colonel Zane, we’re here to escort you to the Osiris.

DX_M13_0580_JUNI
JUNI
Roger that. What’s the situation?

DX_M13_0590_DELTA_LEADER
DELTA LEADER
We took heavy losses during the evacuation. Only four transports and about two dozen fighters made it back to the Osiris.

DX_M13_0600_JUNI
JUNI
That bad?

When they get within 1000m the Battleship Osiris

DX_M13_0610_DELTA_LEADER
DELTA LEADER
Colonel Zane, we’re approaching the Osiris.

DX_M13_0620_JUNI
JUNI
(Commanding)
Ok, this is it. Go ahead and land Trent. I’ll meet up with you on the deck.

Trent docks with the Osiris inside the Nebula field.

SCENE:	S075XA: INT. ORDER BATTLESHIP OSIRIS – LANDING DECK

Trent lands as Juni waits for him on the deck. It’s otherwise empty.

DX_S075X_0101_TRENT
TRENT
Where is everyone?

DX_S075X_0201_JUNI
JUNI
The briefing’s already started. Let’s go!

DX_S075X_02A01_ORILLION
ORILLION
…Is everybody clear on their assignments? Ok, then …

DX_S075X_02B01_OR_PILOT_01
ORDER PILOT 1
Uh-huh!

The two quickly walks from the deck toward the Osiris Lounge Room. Juni and Trent walk into the briefing where Orillion stands in the center of a circle of pilots.

DX_S075X_0301_ORILLION
ORLLION
Ah, Trent, Jun’ko – good, you’ve arrived. We’re just now discussing our attack plan.

DX_S075X_0302_ORILLION
ORLLION
Long-range scans have detected a Nomad Jump Gate in the area that will lead us to our final destination.

DX_S075X_0303_ORILLION
ORLLION
We’ll fly there through the Badlands, which should give us some cover from Nomad attacks.

DX_S075X_0304_ORILLION
ORLLION
We’ll enter the Jumpgate into what we think is the Nomad home world. Once there, we’ll have to improvise.

DX_S075X_0305_ORILLION
ORLLION
We’ll break into four attack groups. Colonel Trent, you will lead Alpha Team.

DX_S075X_0306_ORILLION
ORLLION
I’ll lead Beta and Colonel Zane will head up Gamma.

DX_S075X_0307_ORILLION
ORLLION
A group of heavy bombers will maintain a holding pattern until we can clear them a path. Any questions?

DX_S075X_0308_ORILLION
ORLLION
Okay, let’s go!

DX_S075X_03A01_OR_PILOT_01
ORDER PILOT 1
Let’s get ‘em!

DX_S075X_03A02_OR_PILOT_02
ORDER PILOT 2
Alright!

DX_S075X_03A03_OR_PILOT_03
ORDER PILOT 3
See you in space…

Everybody breaks off and leaves the room.

SCENE:	S075XC: INT. ORDER BATTLESHIP OSIRIS – LANDING DECK

Trent and Juni walk to their ships. They run into Von Claussen – going to his ship. Others run around them.

DX_S075X_0401_TRENT
TRENT
Herr Von Claussen! You’re coming with us?

DX_S075X_0501_VONCLAUSSN
VON CLAUSSEN
Yes, I am. It’s ironic, you know …

DX_S075X_0502_VONCLAUSSN
VON CLAUSSEN
… the outcasts of society have now become the ones to save it.

DX_S075X_0503_VONCLAUSSN
VON CLAUSSEN
In these precious moments, we’ve come together as one people.

DX_S075X_0504_VONCLAUSSN
VON CLAUSSEN
In a way, we’ve already won the battle. Inside.

DX_S075X_0505_VONCLAUSSN
VON CLAUSSEN
(Points, then a change)
But that does not mean the war is over.

DX_S075X_0506_VONCLAUSSN
VON CLAUSSEN
We must still drive the Nomads from our worlds and avenge those we have lost.

DX_S075X_0507_VONCLAUSSN
VON CLAUSSEN
I’m going with you because I owe them something.

DX_S075X_0508_VONCLAUSSN
VON CLAUSSEN
I wouldn’t miss it for the world.

DX_S075X_0601_TRENT
TRENT
Good luck, sir!

DX_S075X_0701_VONCLAUSSN
VON CLAUSSEN
To us all!

They all go to their ships and take off.

OBJECTIVE: LAUNCH TO SPACE

Once Trent appears in space, Orillion, Juni, King, Von Claussen and a large number of Order fighters await him outside.

DX_M13_0630_ORILLION
ORILLION
(Commanding)
Now that we’re all here, let’s move out. The coordinates to the Nomad Jump Gate have been uploaded into everyone’s Neural Nets.

DX_M13_0640_JUNI
JUNI
(Commanding)
Alright people, here we go.

OBJECTIVE: GO TO NOMAD JUMP GATE

Orillion and the other ships fly off…

DX_M13_0650_ORILLION
ORILLION
The Osiris is too large for the Nomad Gate and won’t be able to assist us.

A few seconds later…

DX_M13_0660_ORILLION
ORILLION
(Business-like)
According to our scans, the Nomad Gate is close … just outside the nebula. Expect heavy resistance once we clear it.

DX_M13_0670_VONCLAUSSN
VON CLAUSSEN
What’s our strategy?

This Osiris will create a diversion on the other side of the system. Hopefully, the Nomads will fall for it. Our strategy is to head directly into the Nomad Gate. We believe the alien home world lies directly on the other side. Out best chance is a frontal assault with everything we have.

DX_M13_0690_JUNI
JUNI
(Commanding)
I see the Gate – there it is!

DX_M13_0700_KING
KING
Look at that thing!
(A beat)
I’m not picking up any ships.

DX_M13_0710_ORILLION
ORILLION
Keep your eyes open! The Nomads are bound to know we’re coming.

When they get near the Nomad Jump Gate

DX_M13_0720_JUNI
JUNI
(Alerted – near panic)
There! A Nomad battleship!

DX_M13_0730_KING
KING
(Ready to fight)
All fighters … engage the Nomads.

OBJECTIVE: DESTROY THE NOMAD BATTLESHIP

Reuse the lines M13_0220 to M13_0430.

Once the last Nomad ships have been destroyed:

DX_M13_0740_ORILLION
ORILLION
(Triumphant)
We did it! Alright everybody … this is it.
(Commanding)
Trent, take point through the Jump Hole. Everybody else, follow.

DX_M13_0740B_ORILLION
ORILLION
Trent, take point through the Gate. Everybody else, follow.

OBJECTIVE: JUMP THROUGH NOMAD GATE

Space: Outside the Dyson Sphere

DX_M13_0750_KING
KING
(Curious)
What the heck is that?

DX_M13_0760_ORILLION
ORILLION
(Commanding)
Looks like a giant barrier of some sort. We must find a way to break through it.

DX_M13_0770_JUNI
JUNI
How do we do that?

DX_M13_0780_ORILLION
ORILLION
(Commanding)
I’m reading several strong energy signatures on the surface. Those could be our targets. All ships, head for the barrier.

DX_M13_0790_KING
KING
(Alerted)
We’ve got incoming!

DX_M13_0800_ORILLION
ORILLION
(Commanding)
We have to make sure that Trent can activate the artifact once we’re on the other side. Alpha Wing, take flanking positions!

Alpha wing now flies in formation with Trent. Once Juni gets within 2K of the door:

DX_M13_0810_JUNI
JUNI
I’ve found an entrance through the barrier, but it looks heavily shielded. Looks like several power generators are supplying the shield with enough power that I can’t penetrate it.

Generators are now marked as mission critical objects.

DX_M13_0820_ORILLION
ORILLION
(Commanding)
Understood! Trent, you and your wing have to take out the power generators. All other units continue to engage the Nomad fighters.

OBJECTIVE: DESTORY POWER GENERATORS

IF first generator has been destroyed

DX_M13_0830_JUNI
JUNI
The first generator is gone. Good job, Alpha!

IF second generator has been destroyed

DX_M13_0840_KING
KING
Two down!

IF third generator has been destroyed

DX_M13_0850_VONCLAUSSN
VON CLAUSSEN
Trent’s wing has destroyed the third generator. Only one more…

IF last generator has been destroyed

DX_M13_0860_JUNI
JUNI
You did it, Trent. The shield is going down!

A bright visual effect is emanating from the opening in the barrier.

DX_M13_0870_ORILLION
ORILLION
(Commanding)
All units: proceed through the opening. Trent, you and your wing go first.

DX_M13_0875_JUNI
JUNI
Trent, fly through the opening in the barrier. We’ll follow you.

OBJECTIVE: FLY THROUGH THE BARRIER

There is a small random pop exclusion zone around the position where they appear inside the Dyson’s Sphere.

DX_M13_0880_KING
KING
(In awe)
Wow! Look at this place!

DX_M13_0890_JUNI
JUNI
It looks like the Nomads built a complete shell around this sun!

DX_M13_0900_ORILLION
ORILLION
(Stunned)
Incredible! It’s similar to the old theory of a Dyson’s Sphere. It allows the Nomads to harvest all energy coming from that sun.

DX_M13_0910_VONCLAUSSN
VON CLAUSSEN
What do we do now?

DX_M13_0920_KING
KING
I have a visual. Uploading coordinates. Whatever it is … it’s massive!

DX_M13_0930_ORILLION
ORILLION
All units: proceed to King’s coordinates. Trent, this could be your target.

As they leave the exclusion zone, they are hit with endless streams of Nomad fighters on their way to the Nomad city.

DX_M13_0940_JUNI
JUNI
More Nomad ships!

DX_M13_0950_KING
KING
Here they come!

DX_M13_0960_ORILLION
ORILLION
Trent, Juni, take your wings and proceed to the structure ahead. King, go with them. All other units: stay here and engage the Nomads.

DX_M13_0970_JUNI
JUNI
Alright, it’s up to us.

DX_M13_0980_KING
KING
(Determined)
Let’s put an end to these Nomads … once and for all.

OBJECTIVE: PROCEED TO NOMAD STRUCTURE

Juni, Trent and a few support fighters fly toward the giant structure.

DX_M13_0990_JUNI
JUNI
It’s a city! A giant Nomad city!

DX_M13_1000_KING
KING
(Determined)
I’m reading a strong energy field around the structure. We have to find a way to disable it.

IF player has not destroyed a generator within 60 seconds

DX_M13_1010_KING
KING
(Urgent)
We’re running out of time!

 DX_M13_1020_JUNI
JUNI
Trent, there are several generators powering that shield, much like the ones we destroyed earlier. Try taking them out; we’ll cover you.

DX_M13_1030_KING
KING
(Urgent)
Be careful, Trent. Looks like they’re surrounded by defense platforms!

We now mark all 5 of the generators so the player knows what to destroy

After the first generator is destroyed:

DX_M13_1040_KING
KING
(Triumphant)
Good shot, Trent.
(A beat)
Dammit, no effect yet. Take out another one.

Once the second generator is destroyed:

DX_M13_1050_JUNI
JUNI
(Triumphant)
You did it! The shield is coming down!

SCENE:	SPACE RTC 28: START: NOMAD’S END

The dialogue is very rapid fire – mounting pressure – Each line almost stepping on the other.

DX_M13_1060_ORILLION
ORILLION
(Surprised)
Trent! I’m picking up an energy surge from your ship! Seven hundred rels and rising!

DX_M13_1070_JUNI
JUNI
(Concerned)
Trent, it’s the artifact! Something’s gone wrong!

DX_M13_1080_ORILLION
ORILLION
(Counting quickly – fast paced)
Nine hundred rels!

DX_M13_1090_JUNI
JUNI
(Concerned)
It’s too dangerous! Trent, jettison that thing before it blows.

DX_M13_1100_ORILLION
ORILLION
(Faster)
Twenty five hundred rels!

DX_M13_1110_JUNI
JUNI
(Fearful for him)
TRENT!

Finally...

DX_M13_1120_TRENT
TRENT
(Focused)
No...I’m already committed. We’ve only got one shot at this.

The camera is positioned directly behind Trent’s ship – the huge Nomad city can be seen in the background. Trent’s ship is facing the city and suddenly a bright beam emanates from his ship and flies to the Nomad structure. Once it hits, more beams appear and form horizontal connections between the five “tentacles” of the city. Once the circle is complete, each “tentacle” fires a vertical beam that converges with the others above the Nomad city. A huge Hyper Gate hole forms and sucks up all of the remaining Nomad ships.

DX_M13_1130_ORILLION
ORILLION
The Hyper Gate is open!!!

DX_M13_1140_VONCLAUSSN
VON CLAUSSEN
(Stunned)
It’s beautiful.

DX_M13_1150_ORILLION
ORILLION
--and it’s driving out the Nomads. They can’t take the redistribution of power. --They can’t fight anymore.

DX_M13_1160_KING
KING
(Triumphant)
Whatever you want to call it – we beat ‘em!

DX_M13_1170_JUNI
JUNI
No. There gone but they’re not beaten...

DX_M13_1180_KING
KING
(Bubble bursted)
What? But we just....I mean they’re....

Looking at the Hyper Gate above…

DX_M13_1190_TRENT
TRENT
(Dawning on him)
She’s right... This was only round one...they know we’re here now...they’ll be back.

DX_M13_1200_ORILLION
ORILLION
(Certain - telling)
The Order will watch this gate...and continue our research of the Nomads. We’ll be ready for them next time.

DX_M13_1210_VONCLAUSSN
VON CLAUSSEN
Perhaps with the Gate open we can take the war to them – wherever, indeed, they are...

DX_M13_1220_ORILLION
ORILLION
Perhaps....However for now our work here is done – and in a way – just beginning. There is much to be done in the colonies to repair what has happened. You’re needed at home, Trent.

DX_M13_1230_TRENT
TRENT
Home? And where is that now...?

DX_M13_1240_JUNI
JUNI
(Affectionately)
Manhattan, Trent... You can do a lot of good there.

DX_M13_1250_TRENT
TRENT
“Home...in Manhattan”... You know it doesn’t sound so bad now...Now if I could just get a good sidewinder fang. Let’s go.

Alternate version:

DX_M13_1250B_TRENT
TRENT
Manhattan? Last I checked we were wanted criminals there … and everywhere else in the colonies.

DX_M13_1260_JUNI
JUNI
You’re a Freelancer, Trent. You can go anywhere – and do anything. Besides, I’m sure we can work something out.

We see Trent and Juni’s ship heads for the exit from the Dyson’s Sphere. They fly into the darkness.

SCENE:	SPACE RTC 28: END: NOMAD’S END

The screen fades down and continues with …

SCENE:	S076XA: EXT. PLANET MANHATTAN - CITYSCAPE

SUPER – Six weeks later

Music! Ships fly by. All looks normal. Slow push in to…

SCENE:	S076XB: EXT. PLANET MANHATTAN – BAR

Trent sits alone in the back, looking around, and waiting.

DX_S076X_0101_JUNI
JUNI (O.S.)
Liberty Ale, Mister?

Trent turns and sees Juni walking towards him, smiling. He’s surprised.

DX_S076X_0201_JUNI
JUNI
I’ve never told you … I asked the Bartender about you the day we met…

Trent looks at the Manhattan Bartender.

DX_S076X_0301_TRENT
TRENT
(Smiling)
You did, did you?

DX_S076X_0401_JUNI
JUNI
Mm-hmm. Sorry, I’m late. The debriefing took longer than usual.

DX_S076X_0501_TRENT
TRENT
(Smiling)
I guess you can’t rush the President … or Amnesty.

DX_S076X_0601_JUNI
JUNI
Not to mention the generous reward!

Her attention is drawn to MR. HARRISON, a Liberty Diplomat, thirties, different, a straight shooter, who enters.

DX_S076X_0701_JUNI
JUNI
Hang on, one second, I’ll be right back.

Trent watches her go for a moment. Something catches his eye in a corner. He gets up and walks toward it, looking around. A shadow is standing quietly observing. He steps into the light – it is Orillion.

DX_S076X_0801_TRENT
TRENT
Orillion! Let me tell Juni, you’re here.

Orillion stops him.

DX_S076X_0901_ORILLION
ORILLION
No, Colonel Trent! Even with the colonies rebuilding …

DX_S076X_0902_ORILLION
ORILLION
… and the contaminated human population restored to normal, the threat isn’t over.

DX_S076X_0903_ORILLION
ORILLION
For now, it’s better I stay less well known. I just wanted to see if you’d consider a proposition.

DX_S076X_1201_TRENT
TRENT
What sort of proposition?

DX_S076X_1301_ORILLION
ORILLION
To be the eyes and the ears of the Order here in Liberty! Think about it.

DX_S076X_1302_ORILLION
ORILLION
Enjoy your vacation, Freelancer.

DX_S076X_1303_ORILLION
ORILLION
I’ll be in touch.

Trent hears Juni behind him. He turns in time to see her come up with the Diplomat, arm in arm. Trent looks back and Orillion is gone. Trent smiles…

DX_S076X_1401_TRENT
TRENT
Be seeing you, Casper!

Turns back to Juni…

DX_S076X_1501_JUNI
JUNI
Trent, let me introduce Mr. Harrison, our newest Diplomat. Mr. Harrison, Edison Trent.

CAMERA backs away …

DX_S076X_1601_HARRISON
HARRISON
Edison? What an unusual name.

DX_S076X_1701_TRENT
TRENT
Ah, call me Trent. Pleased to meet you.

DX_S076X_1801_HARRISON
HARRISON
The pleasure is mine, Mr. Trent. President Jacobi speaks highly of you.

… and cranes up.


ALTERNATE ENDING:

CAMERA backs away …

DX_S076X_1601B_HARRISON
HARRISON
Colonel Trent. Our young hero.

Trent and Juni look at each other and smile. Their conversation fades as we DISSOLVE TO:

DX_S076X_1701B_TRENT
TRENT
Please Senator, just call me Trent.

DX_S076X_1801B_HARRISON
HARRISON
Ah, yes … Well, now that you’re here in Liberty, we are told to expect great things from you.

DX_S076X_1901B_TRENT
TRENT
Well, I think it’s safe to say that I’m just getting started.

Trent glances at Juni for a moment and she smiles.  He smoothly returns back to Harrison. Camera cranes up.

SCENE:	S076XC: EXT. PLANET MANHATTAN – CITYSCAPE

Camera continues to pull back to establishing position. Music wells.
